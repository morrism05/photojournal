As we were getting ready to leave, Ethan and Megan woke up and said goodbye. They are heading off to Ireland for St Patrick's Day this evening.</p><p>Katrina and I were uncertain about what to do with our car, seeing as it is on snow tires and how our next destination is the Alps. We decided to stop at the Europcar in Bamberg to see if they had any similar vehicles to offer us, equipped with snow tires. The Bamberg office only had a Ford Kuga SUV to offer. They called the Europcar offices between Bamberg and Garmish to see if there was anything more akin to out 320d, and Munich had a car but it would need to be returned to Munich after our use. This was not possible for our itinerary.</p><p>After a stressful few minutes we decided to risk it and keep the 320d. I was reluctant to take the Kuga when we had so many miles of autobahn ahead of us, and when I had already lost my other Germany driving opportunity - the Nurburgring. Katrina was very concerned that the Alps would be getting snow and that keeping the 320d would ruin our chances of enjoying the mountains. So, we decided to head straight for our hotel in Fussen, thinking that we would feel out the weather as we approached the Alps and in the case of bad snow take the bus to Neuschwanstein.</p><p>At about 9am we left Bamberg and were guided by the GPS to go via Wurzburg and Ulm so as to avoid an accident near Nuremburg. As much as possible, I flat footed it keeping us at about 200kph for much of the trip and getting up to 233kph at one point. It is so wonderful to be treated as a responsible and capable driver and be allowed to drive to your car's capabilities! I wonder how long it would take to cross the USA if we had autobahns.</p><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363286362" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-2OutXRZkyFU/ViGI-l7pEeI/AAAAAAAALTs/21uYmG6M2Jg/s288/IMG_9012.JPG" alt="20130314183922, "><span data-time="1363286362" class="timestamp"><p>Approaching Ulm the landscape changed into tighter bunches of hills. It started snowing again making us nervous. We considered stopping at the Ulm Europcar and turning in the 320d for whatever vehicle was available, but ultimately we decided to continue straight to Neuschwanstein.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363287634" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XFm_XVPKqTE/ViGI-nk7J1I/AAAAAAAALTs/D__0h4EjfhU/s288/IMG_9016.JPG" alt="20130314190034, "><span data-time="1363287634" class="timestamp"><p>We arrived Neuschwanstein around noon, parked and took in the awe inspiring view of the schloss. We purchased tickets and were told that if we hurried, we could make the 1:05pm tour in English. Hurried we did up the mile long road through the snowy woods to the castle.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363289618" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-sCp5dPI51Ec/VhgjsRGk2bI/AAAAAAAAIho/kPlDdQocM0Q/s288/P1410241.JPG" alt="20130314193338, "><span data-time="1363289618" class="timestamp"><p>We arrived with plenty of time to spare, and so we milled around appreciating the castle exterior and the mountains all around. All of the mountains and trees are freshly white from multiple inches of snow. The castle is clean and white too, and has fantastic form. As we would learn on our tour King Ludwig built the castle not as a defensive structure but as a manifestation of the fairy tale lands of Wagner's operas. Hence, it was built for beauty.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363290130" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ooaMkHfIak4/Vhgj0HQsXZI/AAAAAAAAIik/CXjfU1syzD4/s288/P1410252.JPG" alt="20130314194210, "><span data-time="1363290130" class="timestamp"><p>We had a quick snack of pretzel and gluwein (spiced holiday red wine) in a souvenir mug (loaned to us for 2 Euro deposit), then went to line up for our tour. If Disney took inspiration for the Cinderella castle from Neuschwanstein, then Neuschwanstein took inspiration from Disney on how to line up people for an attraction!</p><p>Our tour left on time, and we chaperoned by a young German man through the finished rooms. You see, King Ludwig II only managed to finish about half of the castle before he was declared insane by the state and then mysteriously drown in a lake. As such, the servants floor was finished, and the King's floor was finished, but the guest rooms were uncompleted. As a result of his early death, Ludwig only lived in the castle for 6 months.</p><p>(It was a no photos tour, but tried to sneak some in.)</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363292361" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-upKNBkZg9TM/VhgkVE5IbfI/AAAAAAAAIm8/Pxm15zp0Fls/s288/P1410298.JPG" alt="20130314201921, "><span data-time="1363292361" class="timestamp"><p>We buzzed by the servants quarters and up a spiral stair case to the third floor, where Ludwig's rooms were. First we visited the chapel, which was a bright and colorful as the other highlight German chapels we have seen on this trip. The floors were intricate tile mosaic, a massive crown shaped chandelier filled the center of the room, and all the walls were painted fresco scenes. I was particularly tickled by the Jesus over a rainbow on the wall above the alter place.</p><p>We passed a Spanish Moor inspired hall and through a dining room to Ludwig's bedroom, which was decorated in dark carved wood (similar to the choir seats in cathedrals). The king's bed had an intricate carved canopy of Gothic arches and flourishes. His wash sink was a bowing swan.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363293195" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-O0Re0DteAZs/VhgkfhDiWxI/AAAAAAAAIoU/65nVonT1A1Q/s288/P1410311.JPG" alt="20130314203315, "><span data-time="1363293195" class="timestamp"><p>Neuschwanstein actually means new swan stone and swan was Ludwig's royal mascot. When we entered the next room, his dressing room, we found the swan on many surfaces, including the curtains and frescos.</p><p>Ludwig loved Wagner operas and built his castle around their spirit. In many of the rooms, including the dining room, bedroom, and dressing room, scenes from operas were painted on the walls.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363293547" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--9GuJ4TOovs/Vhgkifzl0TI/AAAAAAAAIos/jBsKOzayrP8/s288/P1410315.JPG" alt="20130314203907, "><span data-time="1363293547" class="timestamp"><p>Leaving the dressing room, we then proceeded through an artificial cave ("a man cave!" exclaimed one guest) and eventually up the the grand hall on the top floor. This hall has a built in stage and is where Ludwig would watch opera/theater. Ludwig was a very shy king and so usually he would watch these plays alone, however the room is big enough for 500 patrons and now, during the fall it is open to the public for shows. My favorite aspect of the theater hall was the deep green forest painted on the stage backdrop.</p><p>This completed our tour. As we were leaving we heard other guests asking the guide how you get to the bridge overlook that views the castle. The guide said that this area was closed, but if you wanted to go there you could jump the gate on the path at the exit of the tour.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363294596" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-dpsdlxIYKNI/Vhgkj8kO6ZI/AAAAAAAAIo4/2a9CjEcYT1k/s288/P1410317.JPG" alt="20130314205636, "><span data-time="1363294596" class="timestamp"><p>Jump the gate we did and we actually found the path to be mostly clear of snow and ice. We took in views of the adjacent Hohenschwangau castle and Alpsee lake, and then found the bridge overlook to Neuschwanstein. What a breathtaking view!</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363299657" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-kqNAYfq_Ij4/ViGI-vQth1I/AAAAAAAALTs/8-C2V5jCes8/s288/IMG_9128.JPG" alt="20130314222057, "><span data-time="1363299657" class="timestamp"><p>After taking many photos we returned to our car intent on visiting Austria (just 10 minutes south). We drove a loop from Fussen to Pingswang, Austria then through a pass containing Plansee, Ammerwald and Linderhof. The peak of the pass was at Ammerwald, and all around were evergreen trees, a think covering of snow and rocky mountains rising to the sky. It was so beautiful!</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363303920" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-iklF7eq7t8c/ViGI-gW_qFI/AAAAAAAALTk/-wKUwfXmVfY/s288/IMG_9177.JPG" alt="20130314233200, "><span data-time="1363303920" class="timestamp"><p>Just before Linderhof we passed a German military unit with multiple jeeps and snow cats encamped on the road. They had flaggers slowing and controlling traffic on both sides of the encampment, and so we crept through wondering what exactly they were up too. Ethan had mentioned that the German army does Alpine exercises, so perhaps we witnessed one!</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363304580" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-JcVpgfMafsw/Vhglog2-5VI/AAAAAAAAIyE/vr5CrnYNZ-4/s288/P1410422.JPG" alt="20130314234300, "><span data-time="1363304580" class="timestamp"><p>We stopped briefly at Linderhof, but it was after hours so we could only walk around the grounds. Linderhof actually looks like quite a small palace, perhaps just 10% of the size of Neuschwanstein.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363307404" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-uDitETz2jao/ViGI-ngUS8I/AAAAAAAALTs/-18WgN2rzs0/s288/IMG_9183.JPG" alt="20130315003004, "><span data-time="1363307404" class="timestamp"><p>We returned to Fussen via Oberammergau and Steingaden, passing through a few snow flurries and catching a spectacular sunset. After checking into our hotel we went for a supper yummy Greek dinner at Kelari. We ordered giant beans in tomato sauce, stuffed squash flowers, Greek salad, fried eggplant and zucchini with tataziki sauce, finished with baklava. It was all super good, and our waitress gave us samplers of Greek Schnapps on the house. I really liked their licorice flavor.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363316061" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-aUi5Efpg3-Q/VhgmLOy_1GI/AAAAAAAAI3c/D0u3jbvOsxk/s288/P1410482.JPG" alt="20130315025421, "><span data-time="1363316061" class="timestamp"><p>It was snowing as we walked back to the Hotel Fantasia and our castle view room (we can see one of the city's castle, and there is a photograph of Neuschwanstein on the ceiling) with its 4 beds. We wrote postcards and journalled, then went to bed.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363317102" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-WjDghw5vxn8/VhgmMWt-NdI/AAAAAAAAI3k/UFy0JSWCHhI/s288/P1410484.JPG" alt="20130315031142, "><span data-time="1363317102" class="timestamp"><p id="endOfEntry">&lt;End of Journal&gt;</p></span>

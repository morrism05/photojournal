I wrote in my journal until Katrina awoke. We then went for breakfast in the courtyard; I had french toast with bananas, Katrina had a pancake with bananas. I brought over three remaining mangoes to our breakfast table and cut them up. One was green, the other was being eaten by two little white worms (the worm moved by which scrunching its body into a 'U' and then springing and by this mode it could jump several inches), and the last mango was just right. We ate this one.</p><p>We packed and hung out in the room until 10am. At that point we met Set at reception. He arrived with a refund for our first day's taxi and with two gift scarfs from the office.</p><p>We had a short ride to the airport where Set and the driver said goodbye. Set did not bother coming into the airport check-in counter with us; I don't really mind, but he is the first guide to skip this step.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401127642" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-z2eWQI5IvUo/VkoZolZx4hI/AAAAAAAAfMI/zVWGM57qbOU/s288/P1480415.JPG" alt="20140526180722, "><span data-time="1401127642" class="timestamp"><p>We went through a very smiley security check, and then went to the Bangkok Airways lounge. Bangkok Airways offers a lounge with internet and snacks for all travelers on its flights. The snacks were varied, though none of the savory snacks were vegetarian. I ended up eating lots of brownies, biscuits, popcorn, and rice crackers. The internet at this lounge was pretty fast too, so I caught up on YouTube.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401131516" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-C8Me7Tl3cnM/VkoZovn41xI/AAAAAAAAfMI/JP8TFjjlq7Q/s288/P1480417.JPG" alt="20140526191156, "><span data-time="1401131516" class="timestamp"><p>Our flight to Bangkok was PG906, and was on a modest sized turboprop. We were sat near the rear of the plane. The flight was just over one hour long, and pretty uneventful. Bangkok Air fed us a small meal of grilled veggies and salads.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401138358" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-tRnrfXksjqs/VkoZokYpx4I/AAAAAAAAfMI/sq6-st1NBbw/s288/P1480423.JPG" alt="20140526210558, "><span data-time="1401138358" class="timestamp"><p>When we landed at BKK we were bused to the terminal, then went through a transfer process where our passports were inspected and new visas granted. Our bags were automatically forward to Ko Samui, so we did not need to fetch them at all. We found the Bangkok Airways for our domestic flight PG169 right across the terminal from our gate. We had about 2.5 hours of downtime before our flight, so we again grazed on the available bite-sized snacks (pretty much the same offerings as in Siem Reap) and used the internet. There were no signs whatsoever in BKK that the military was in control of the country and the constitution has been suspended.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401147454" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-fAmMF9QjaVI/VkoZoq-CGqI/AAAAAAAAfMI/A7vU4iv7kmU/s288/P1480426.JPG" alt="20140526233734, "><span data-time="1401147454" class="timestamp"><p>PG169 was on an Airbus 319, and it was only a 45 minute flight to the island. Basically, the flight attendants rushed out the meal service (on a 45 minute flight they served a meal!) while we were still ascending, we cruised at altitude for five minutes and then we descended. We were able to see a few neighboring islands on the descent. They look green, tall and beautiful. The skies today are filled with scattered clouds, so the water color looked silver.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401152798" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-tfiy6_2rqKc/VkoZoiQUqJI/AAAAAAAAfMA/MyCO2I9jSZw/s288/P1480438.JPG" alt="20140527010638, "><span data-time="1401152798" class="timestamp"><p>ICS had a guide and a van waiting at the airport for us. It was just a five minute ride to our hotel, Al Laemson's Resort. This hotel is just beyond the north end of Chaweng Beach, the premiere beach on Ko Samui. Katrina had read some pretty yucky things about this resort while we had internet access today, and so she approached it with skeptical eyes. She was looking for dirty rooms, bugs in the rooms, stinky bathrooms, dirty towels, broken equipment, unclean swimming pools and an "unswimmable" beach. Our Deluxe Villa room turned out to be mostly clean (there are some water stains and smudges on the walls, and the bathroom counter has water stains too), rodent droppings in the bathroom, threadbare towels, a toilet seat which is only connected with one screw, a shower head (on a hose) which is mounted at the height of your knees, no view of anything, an infinity pool which no longer overflows its edges, on a beach with coarse sand and many small fishing boats. I think one could swim here if they wanted, but the beach is behind a breakwater.</p><p>Clearly Katrina had hoped to find a charming cottage with ocean views and a bit of romance for our Ko Samui stay. Instead we were at an aged resort with a motel quality room. We decided to walk into the heart of Chaweng Beach to see if we could find a nicer place to stay.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401156642" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-2Uu-FAMYjF4/VkoZoofjZMI/AAAAAAAAfMA/aINfc4UISX0/s288/P1480444.JPG" alt="20140527021042, "><span data-time="1401156642" class="timestamp"><p>We walked south down the main road for about five minutes before the road became constantly lined with tourist shops and restaurants. There were plenty of shills trying to get us come to their restaurant or bar, attend their boxing match, buy a tailored suit (this is Thailand). Lighted signs overhung the sidewalks hawking the same wears, tourists in beach or evening clothes strolled up and down. It felt very touristy and very resort-y, roughly equivalent to the Old Market in Siem Reap but with a much more westernized bent.</p><p>We knew we were parallel to the nice stretch of Chaweng beach, but our access was blocked by stores and hotels. We ducked through a half developed lot to get to the beach and were very pleasantly impressed. The beach is very thin, but the sand is soft and white and palm trees stretch out from the resorts' edges towards the water. Most of the resorts still had their beach chairs out on the sand, though a few had set out tables for fine dining.</p><p>We looked in the resorts as we walked, and very soon came across an attractive hotel called Amari. We entered the resort and inquired about the price - we were quoted about 3600 THB ($120) per night for a double on the far side of the road.</p><p>We decided to keep walking until we got to Al's sister hotel, which is on Chaweng beach. There we had the hotel staff show us a double room too. The room was roughly equivalent to the one we have at our current hotel, however it was a bit smaller, much less private, and there was someone grinding into the cement sidewalk with a rotary power tool outside. The price was about $66 without breakfast. Kat said that online the same hotel is about $35.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401160031" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Z-YDKp3BHGg/VkoZopPFGLI/AAAAAAAAfMA/LJl_8nZ52g0/s288/P1480445.JPG" alt="20140527030711, "><span data-time="1401160031" class="timestamp"><p>We wanted to find a place were we could use the internet to search hotel prices. We had passed signage for Gringos Mexican Restaurant earlier, and two Thai ladies in Mexican dress had been trying to lure passersby into the restaurant. Lured by the thought of a margarita, we went to Gringos ourselves.</p><p>Most of the Mexican food entrees were priced around $10, but in the back of the menu was a selection of Thai dishes priced at $4. Thus, we ended up with a half liter pitcher of margarita (which was actually pretty good), a basket of chips with guacamole, refried beans and salsa, and a vegetable red curry. Nothing was a weird Asian interpretation of the real item, so we were happy.</p><p>Using the WiFi and Gringos we were also able to find a $110/night price on Amari hotel. I'll get another 9% back in rewards credit, to bring the price down further. We decided to book tomorrow and Wednesday night at Amari, to add some charm to our stay. We plan on using the Amari beach tomorrow during our free day.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401163678" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-VCBTsV2e_dc/VkoZonDawnI/AAAAAAAAfMA/iAy53EafZ_U/s288/P1480447.JPG" alt="20140527040758, "><span data-time="1401163678" class="timestamp"><p>We walked back to our hotel after dinner using the beach as much as possible. The tide had come in during dinner, and the dining tables that the hotels had put on the beach were nearly in the waters. Still, it was pleasant to walk along the sand in the dark, with the hotel and restaurant lights on our left, the still waters on our right (with distant flashes of lightning on the horizon) and the alternating breezes of hot and less hot air.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401165179" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-JnX4_x_OiRQ/VkoZohjLujI/AAAAAAAAfMA/TjNALoWyJrY/s288/P1480448.JPG" alt="20140527043259, "><span data-time="1401165179" class="timestamp"><p>We got back to the hotel, found it nice and cool (as we had left the AC on when we left), showered, got ready for bed, and slept.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401165227" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-75B5YSqerxU/VkoZoujb7TI/AAAAAAAAfMA/nXCdKHQ1ljA/s288/P1480450.JPG" alt="20140527043347, "><span data-time="1401165227" class="timestamp"><p id="endOfEntry">&lt;End of Journal&gt;</p></span>

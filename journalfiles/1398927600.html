We could make out boats on the bay and a few islands but that was about it. After doing more searching of the seats for the missing contact - it was not found - we deplaned into the modern airport with its long long terminals. Immigration was very easy and quick and although my bag was the last on the carousal we then cleared customs without any checks. We took out some cash from the ATM (the exchange rate is about $1USD = $7.5 HKD) and bought train tickets into the city. We transferred to the metro and found our Hotel Dorsett in the Mongkok neighborhood close to the Olympic metro stop.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1398959571" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-0iwvwHE9jxA/ViGp8xa53jI/AAAAAAAAMys/QzV9IVKkNBc/s288/P1450379.JPG" alt="20140501155251, "><span data-time="1398959571" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1398959571" class="timestamp"><p>It was only about 8:30am when we arrived at the Dorsett, and our room was not yet ready so they stored our bags and sent us away. Strangely to us, not much of the city is open at this time of the morning - most stores and even some eateries are still closed until 10 or 11am. Perhaps today is a holiday?</p><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1398959658" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-fYpkAixOgCQ/ViGp8wYaWdI/AAAAAAAAMys/myQN9f26GxU/s288/P1450380.JPG" alt="20140501155418, "><p>We headed back to the metro. Along the way we walked through some street marketplaces where people were shopping for their fresh foodstuffs, including veggies, meat, and live fish and poultry. The market reminded me of the SF Chinatown markets, with their exotic and slightly bruised goods pouring onto the streets. Mongkok appears to be very much a locals' neighborhood, as we did not see many other Caucasians on the sidewalks.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1398961935" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-iS6k6aS_6Es/ViGp8_t0fsI/AAAAAAAAMys/OLUT8fVxHps/s288/P1450386.JPG" alt="20140501163215, "><span data-time="1398961935" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1398961935" class="timestamp"><p>We went via metro to Diamond Hill to find the Chi Lin nunnery and Nan Lian gardens. The metro is a very clean and efficient system, with very good English signage which has made it a breeze for us to use. We have been buying single ride tickets when we enter the station, and the ticket price differs depending on how far you plan to travel. All of the subway trains have electric signage telling you where you are and where you can transfer, which is also easy to understand.</p><p>The gardens and nunnery are connected sites that Marusia (Diede's wife) recommended to us. The Nan Lian gardens are Chinese style gardens with lot of grass, hill, tree, rock and water features. The gardens focus on a central pond and pagoda, but have side buildings with rock gardens, gift shops and restaurants. The gardens were peaceful and pretty, and I found the fake fog making machines around the pond to be quite comical. The gardens were also a bit stinky from Chinese laurel blooms.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1398964959" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-zDh4Kd3DxUE/ViGp81GgrFI/AAAAAAAAMys/ezw5KKDDz5M/s288/IMG_2278.JPG" alt="20140501172239, "><span data-time="1398964959" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1398964959" class="timestamp"><p>We then crossed over to the temple complex of the nunnery, and inspected the multiple courtyards, coy ponds, and sanctuaries containing golden Buddhas. Katrina and I were both feeling tired by this point and stopped to sit and rest in a courtyard. We were quickly but kindly tisk-tisked by a guard; sitting is not allowed here.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1398968289" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Uib8wGvF_hg/ViGp854jB8I/AAAAAAAAMyo/f_fkMBUe7ig/s288/P1450411.JPG" alt="20140501181809, "><span data-time="1398968289" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1398968289" class="timestamp"><p>There was an hour and a half to kill before the on-grounds Chi Lin vegetarian restaurant opened for lunch, so Katrina and I went into a nearby mall called Hollywood Park to do some window shopping. We inspected the supermarket (nice and European feeling with tight isles and bright lights) and then came across an optometrist. A young and helpful clerk checked Katrina's eyes and made a recommendation about disposable contact lenses that she could use. She purchased two boxes which we hope will take her through the length of our trip.</p></span><span data-time="1398970248" class="timestamp"><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1398969727" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Wun_08kOgpA/VjeaSzHbQAI/AAAAAAAAenE/tVWKjO0bnPg/s288/IMG_20140501_114207.jpg" alt="20140501184207, "><p>Before noon we returned to the Chi Lin restaurant and ordered the four-course sampler plus dumplings for Katrina and the five-course sampler for me. I really liked the bean curd and mushroom dish from my meal, Katrina found her dumplings to be a treat.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1398976098" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ryajAD5bd-M/ViGp8z8rWkI/AAAAAAAAMys/F-9uYOmgMqU/s288/IMG_2279.JPG" alt="20140501202818, "><span data-time="1398976098" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1398976098" class="timestamp"><p>After lunch we took the subway to Central (which is across the bay) and to the heart Hong Kong city. We headed to the Central Escalators (another Marusia suggestion) which bring commuters to the harborside central towers from their hilltop residences. Hong Kong is several islands of lush green forested mountains, and wherever man has cut back the trees he has replaced them with tall office buildings and apartment blocks. The smaller apartments blocks are 14 stories tall, the larger ones are maybe 35 stories tall. Most of the apartment blocks are plain in appearance - painted concrete towers with in-window AC units popping out of many of the windows - but there are a few more modern glass and steel buildings too. Anyway, the central escalators service these up-the-hill residences. We rode about 75% of the way up the length, then disembarked and meandered our way down through the neighborhoods of SoHo and Hollywood Ave. SoHo was particularly compelling with its many fresh and modern restaurants (frequented by a very Western/tourist looking crowd). We walked past a few vegetarian places too. As our meander got back down towards the base of the elevator, we passed through a few more street markets with produce stalls and street food.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1398979330" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-4GYLesXZ4M4/ViGp87Tux5I/AAAAAAAAMyo/mY0Hfn5DD5A/s288/P1450438.JPG" alt="20140501212210, "><span data-time="1398979330" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1398979330" class="timestamp"><p>We took the elevated sidewalks from Central to the adjacent harbor. One curious sight which we don't yet understand is that in these broad elevated sidewalks many many working age women have laid out cardboard on the pavement and were sharing conversation, cards, or lunch together. We don't know why only women were sitting out this way, or why they were all our there at 3:30pm. Was it lunch or break time?</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1398980489" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-jaGDkLN--8E/ViGp8w2gDNI/AAAAAAAAMys/h0j8nI9IdEw/s288/P1450445.JPG" alt="20140501214129, "><span data-time="1398980489" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1398980489" class="timestamp"><p>From the harbor we took the Star Line ferry to Tsim Sha Tsui (the closest stop on the far side of the harbor). This short trip afforded us nice views of Central city and its many skyscrapers. Tsim Sha Tsui is just as busy and bustling as Central, and we quickly retreated to our hotel to get our room and clean up.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1398986049" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-qwACgH4IXMs/ViGp854wTeI/AAAAAAAAMys/_3rS4_bhrec/s288/P1450472.JPG" alt="20140501231409, "><span data-time="1398986049" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1398986049" class="timestamp"><p>Our room is 2706 and is on the top (27th) floor of the building. The room is very small, but also nice and comfortable. We are a little disappointed that the in-room "free" internet has a $12HKD/day server fee. At least we have good panoramic views looking at the Mongkok neighborhood and the mountains to hold our attention.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1398999445" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-kSQvRtbgWF0/ViGp86XBVlI/AAAAAAAAMys/0Y0Sz6tnRUQ/s288/P1450477.JPG" alt="20140502025725, "><span data-time="1398999445" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1398999445" class="timestamp"><p>We headed back to the central escalators for dinner, and ate at Life Cafe. It seemed like all of the patrons were English speaking Westerners, but the food suited us well. The menu is strictly vegetarian and we tried some terrific tea leaf smoked eggplant, a mushroom white-pizza, and an African peanut stew. Yummy all around.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399003676" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-mEOq-NO7Syk/ViGp81AZJGI/AAAAAAAAMys/AAqhheqPWpM/s288/P1450480.JPG" alt="20140502040756, "><span data-time="1399003676" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399003676" class="timestamp"><p>After dinner we tried to find a supermarket in Central or Mongkok where we could procure breakfast items, but none of the places we stopped in had what we wanted. So we returned to the hotel to get some sleep. (The view out of the night time window is quite awesome.)</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399004995" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XT_-uRkg0hY/ViGp82co_HI/AAAAAAAAMys/AKnf7drzdJQ/s288/P1450483.JPG" alt="20140502042955, "><span data-time="1399004995" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399004995" class="timestamp"><p id="endOfEntry">&lt;End of Journal&gt;</p></span></span>

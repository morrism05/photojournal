Katrina and I were a bit confused about the precise time as in the US daylight's savings time had adjusted and now our phones had sprung 1 hour forward. We ate at the house, me a bagel and Katrina yogurt with muesli, and then headed out of the house.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1362941211" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-jJmyKI9p-KQ/Vhgcs-bnHBI/AAAAAAAAHjU/HHwiuCxJpp4/s288/P1400564.JPG" alt="20130310184651, "><span data-time="1362941211" class="timestamp"><p>We walked down Panzerleite road to the base of the old city walls, enjoying the houses we passed. The houses here are actually rather large, and sit on sizable lots. At the first bus stop we passed, I inspected a cigarette vending machine offering quite a large array of choices for 5 to 6 Euros per pack. Machines like these are all over Bamberg, sometimes 1 per block!</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1362941892" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-qOdRvM21IK8/Vhgcx2rrL1I/AAAAAAAAHj8/Ohhdm1KZ_no/s288/P1400571.JPG" alt="20130310185812, "><span data-time="1362941892" class="timestamp"><p>We strolled in a small park at the base of the Dom (German for cathedral), then turned to wind our way up to the Dom itself. It turned 11am as we started the ascent, and the ringing of three bell towers from different churches could be heard all at once.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1362942483" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-OuM1fdSkA5A/Vhgc6orOFzI/AAAAAAAAHlU/ZOYO6OsjGh0/s288/P1400582.JPG" alt="20130310190803, "><span data-time="1362942483" class="timestamp"><p>As it was Sunday, services were still underway, so we explored the neighborhood around the cathedral. We first visited the rose garden, which looks out over the city spread along the riverside. We were able to spot some of the places we visited yesterday, including the island with the spaghetti restaurant and the old town around the river. Right below the rose garden was the brewery which brewed some of the beers from last night. Up on an adjacent hillside was St Michael's, or Michaelsberg, monastery. It was really a pretty place to take in the city.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1362943682" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-PDZiWwjtE3A/VhgdQ3ODAfI/AAAAAAAAHoY/dnOR41N_X80/s288/P1400616.JPG" alt="20130310192802, "><span data-time="1362943682" class="timestamp"><p>We then explored the small streets behind the cathedral, enjoying the a historic courtyard, cobblestone streets, and the little pub by the city gates that Megan and Ethan frequent.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1362945285" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-vwgmbHqJf7k/VhgdrSD0aWI/AAAAAAAAHsI/BeoDK6zYm0U/s288/P1400663.JPG" alt="20130310195445, "><span data-time="1362945285" class="timestamp"><p>We returned to the Dom and noticed that the parking lot had emptied, so we decided it safe to explore the cathedral. The Dom is has dark stone construction, and minimal decoration inside. The main altar has a free standing statue of Christ with three attendants. The opposite side of the main hall had a painted dome. We also peeked in the crypt and saw the relic (a bone?).</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1362946750" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-eMAuTsrUYjo/Vhgd64KUqAI/AAAAAAAAHuc/P5qLGLovKxI/s288/P1400700.JPG" alt="20130310201910, "><span data-time="1362946750" class="timestamp"><p>We left the Dom and walked down down to the riverside with the goal of finding food. We walked along the river and enjoyed the Venice-like houses again. I spotted an interesting mural and boathouse with what appears to be boat jousting. Two challengers standing on thin boats swing at each other with padded poles. We wandered around down town looking at menus and trying to find some Asian or middle eastern food. I was hoping to spot a Thai restaurant, but failed to find one. We crossed the river through the Rathaus (the city government building built on the river) and then explored the island. The falafel shop by yesterday's spaghetti restaurant was closed, so we walked down the pedestrian shopping mall. We crossed a bridge on the far side of the mall and purchased a pretzel to tide us over.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1362950543" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-iIs_weFAw9s/VhgeHiDm3WI/AAAAAAAAHwI/KzYTonPNlo4/s288/P1400716.JPG" alt="20130310212223, "><span data-time="1362950543" class="timestamp"><p>We returned back to the island and on Promenadestrasse we found Kam-Fok Chinese, where we ordered glass noodles and broccoli. The food was decent, but more importantly it was warming and restoring. The table directly next to us appeared to be filled with some US Army families.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1362953652" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-0Uurd-ZpHTc/VhgeOMDLzYI/AAAAAAAAHxA/Z3iujQTXSEo/s288/P1400725.JPG" alt="20130310221412, "><span data-time="1362953652" class="timestamp"><p>After lunch we dropped by Deutsche Banke to withdraw more cash, then wound our way back to the house. It appears to be Easter in Bamberg, and the storefronts have Easter displays and people have decorated their yards and flower boxes with Easter eggs. To make the trip scenic, we criss-crossed the river a few times then climbed up the hill on the cobblestone Oberer Stephansberg road.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1362958900" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Vl1fI_q99Gw/Vhgelh7HqvI/AAAAAAAAH0M/yPfD4gOr_YY/s288/P1400752.JPG" alt="20130310234140, "><span data-time="1362958900" class="timestamp"><p>Megan and Ethan were preparing for a run when we returned, so we hoped in the car and drove up to Altenburg to see the castle and views in the daylight. The country side here is low rolling hills, with lots of green fields and a broad swatch of city around Bamberg. Far off on the horizon a wind farm can be seen. Bamberg appears to mainly be a red roofed city, with many church towers protruding from the mix.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1362960319" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-375quxELMvA/Vhge07uJMjI/AAAAAAAAH2Y/_b4aQEdjG_Y/s288/P1400773.JPG" alt="20130311000519, "><span data-time="1362960319" class="timestamp"><p>On the way back down from Altenburg, Katrina and I stopped to investigate the BMW more closely. I checked the tires to see what might be their speed rating, and noticed that the Potenza S001's are not actually snow tires but just standard, summer run flats. We then spent 5 minutes playing with the manually adjustable sports seats. The seats raise, lower, tip fore and aft, adjust lumbar, extends thigh support. I was able to sink the seat down so that I can look under the rear view mirror, rather than ducking every time I need to look out to the right. We actually were able to get really comfortable with all the choices available.</p><p>In general my take on the 320d is that it is a comfortable car with a sporting ride. The engine though is not sporting, even if it is a willing partner to take you to sporting speeds. Mainly, the engine lacks all of the aural cues that excite a car enthusiast and while it will woosh you forward, it does so without the fast revving rush of a petrol engine. I like the car, but right now could not see owning it.</p><p>We rejoined Ethan and Megan at the house, and took a breather. Katrina and Megan worked on physics homework and I worked on this journal.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1362967347" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-p0-r9rpPn0Y/ViFjQQeY7hI/AAAAAAAAKOQ/clWZrujE3wk/s288/IMG_20130310_140227.jpg" alt="20130311020227, "><span data-time="1362967347" class="timestamp"><p>For dinner we ventured back into Bamberg to Restaurant Kornblume to enjoy their largely vegetarian menu. We shared some fabulous bruschetta on thick crunchy bread, and then Katrina and I split a wurst and potatoes dish (the "wurst" was a salty paste whose flavor I struggle to remember, the potatoes were like good homefries) and a kasespatse which was similar to a chewy macaroni and cheese. It was yummy if very heavy food. The other defining experience of the meal was that about half way through the evening the waitress disappeared and table-side service was assumed by the chef, a tall, young man with a scruffy blond beard. It is a bit odd to interact with the chef of a restaurant, and I felt compelled tell him how good the food at the table was.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1362970727" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-gPVp5W9_JMY/ViFjQVMIIqI/AAAAAAAAKOQ/21pUrAxLckc/s288/IMG_20130310_145847.jpg" alt="20130311025847, "> <span data-time="1362970727" class="timestamp"><p>&lt;End of Journal&gt;</p></span>

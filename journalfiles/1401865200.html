Our main concern was that the long descent from the mountain would be slippery in the wet.</p><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401890379" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ytPsVrhmTnU/Vky3VW6r3iI/AAAAAAAAfXs/XvLUNzmERv0/s288/P1490387.JPG" alt="20140604135939, "><span data-time="1401890379" class="timestamp"><p>Thus, we woke at 6am (Koguchi has an alarm siren which sounds at 6am, 4pm and 9pm every day), packed and at 7am had breakfast in the dining area (which is also the entry hall!) with Annemarie and Joy. The breakfast spread was very nice with fresh fruit, yogurt, eggs, pickled veggies, eggplant, rice, miso soup, and fish. Katrina was bequeathed my fish.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401893277" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Sfcet0srchI/Vky3VebzS2I/AAAAAAAAfXU/u0ZLSvVPFSE/s288/IMG_4368.JPG" alt="20140604144757, "><span data-time="1401893277" class="timestamp"><p>It was not raining when we left the minshuku around 7:50am. We said lengthy goodbyes to our host and hostess, and then were walked to our bus stop.</p><p>Our host had explained that we would need to take several buses to get to the temples and waterfall at Nachi-san. The first bus was to take us from Koguchi to Shingu. It took us about 45 minutes to take the winding route out of the mountains via river valleys with glacial green waters (even though there are no glaciers feeding these rivers!) and to the coast. I had been wondering if any locals ride the bus as the prices for rides are so high, but we were indeed joined by two elderly women on our trip.</p><p>The Shingu bus station is right next to the JR-Rail stop and was the end of the line for our first bus. We found an info station in the bus depot where I asked for an ATM. Katrina and I were running low on cash and we were not sure if we had enough money to cover the rides to Nachi-san and back. The info desk lady told me where the ATM was located, but she said that it did not open until 9am. This would not work as our next bus was due to leave at 9am. Annemarie also talked with the info desk lady and learned that we would need to change buses an additional time at Nachi station.</p><p>We boarded our second bus and rode for 10 minutes out of Shingu and southwest along the coast to Nachi. Shingu is actually a very significant town, with rows of downtown streets and a few malls and strip malls too. The coast is clearly much more developed that inland.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401900776" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-uZEr41yCMW0/Vky3VU5MWDI/AAAAAAAAfXs/qbPYmN9pjKg/s288/P1490408.JPG" alt="20140604165256, "><span data-time="1401900776" class="timestamp"><p>At Nachi station I tried again to find an ATM, but there was none nearby. In about 10 minutes our third bus to Nachi-san arrived, and we traveled first along the coast and then inland up a valley. One of the attractions of Nachi-san is a a long stone staircase lined with ancient cedar trees that leads to (or from) the temples. Katrina had the good idea of getting off the bus at the base of the staircase and climbing it up to the temples, to give us a chance to walk the stairs in the dry and to also give us the pilgrim's experience of laboring to reach the temples. Thus, just as the bus started to climb the hill, we signaled to stop and alighted at the base of the steps. Joy and Annemarie also followed us off the bus.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401901320" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-1EfKpz_TGKo/Vky3VZpIt8I/AAAAAAAAfXU/MIQ4lbsH24Q/s288/IMG_4371.JPG" alt="20140604170200, "><span data-time="1401901320" class="timestamp"><p>The Daimonzaka-chaya steps start (at the bottom) by passing through a pair of the largest cedar trees I have ever seen. These are the "husband and wife" trees. The stone steps then continue 600 meters and 267 stairs up the hill. The broad staircase is made of somewhat uneven stones, and is lined all the way with thick old cedar trees.</p><p>We walked up ahead of Joy and Annemarie, and in fact out paced them so much that we did not see them any more during the day. Along the way we met other tourists (all Japanese) climbing the steps too, and every one was friendly and greeted us with konichiwa.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401902967" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-5FErh_wTot8/Vky3VX3ljDI/AAAAAAAAfXs/-qzuegcuOCs/s288/P1490426.JPG" alt="20140604172927, "><span data-time="1401902967" class="timestamp"><p>At the top of the steps we entered into Nachi-san town, which feels a bit like an overgrown tourist trap in its lower levels. I guess we are in the off season though, as most shops were closed and very few tourists were about.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401903717" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-fhhV-SfUvEQ/Vky3VYvHmBI/AAAAAAAAfXU/SbmNIfBoxpE/s288/IMG_4387.JPG" alt="20140604174157, "><span data-time="1401903717" class="timestamp"><p>We headed first for the view of the three-storied pagoda with the Nachi-no-Otaki waterfall behind. We had seen pictures of this pair before coming to Japan, and we had been thinking of it as the treat at the end of our hike. (Along the way through town to the view we came across and ATM and withdrew 60,000 yen which we expect to take us through the rest of our trip.)</p><p>The view of the pagoda and waterfall were as lovely as we had hoped. The pagoda is painted a bright orange which might be appropriate for the Golden Gate Bridge. The Nachi-no-Otaki waterfall is Japan's tallest at 133m, and today it was blowing sideways in the winds which were bringing in the coming storm.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401905181" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-e-oA2W7HRWo/Vky3VQKzMxI/AAAAAAAAfXs/kjCb93LXxiY/s288/IMG_4427.JPG" alt="20140604180621, "><span data-time="1401905181" class="timestamp"><p>We took many photos from both the outside and balconies of the pagodas. We were surprised to find a very racy mural of aroused men and women on the pagoda's second floor.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401905631" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-gMhctHvvVHM/Vky3VZDOReI/AAAAAAAAfXs/8Jc-oOp714Q/s288/P1490453.JPG" alt="20140604181351, "><span data-time="1401905631" class="timestamp"><p>Next we went up to the Kumano Seiganto-ji temple, one of the three most sacred temples on the Kumano Kodo pilgrimage and a destination for pilgrims. This temple is the oldest on the site and is made of unpainted wood which appears to be quite weathered. We admired the temple from the outside and then ventured inside and were a little surprised to find many things being sold inside. I think these were prayer and wish items that one would buy for worship purposes, but is still felt a bit like a gift shop! Also directly inside the main entrance was a massive rope about one foot in diameter which could be swung to chime a huge gong.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401906496" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-G0kxqWvQDFM/Vky3VSvXexI/AAAAAAAAfXs/W-Hzdhnd_r0/s288/P1490462.JPG" alt="20140604182816, "><span data-time="1401906496" class="timestamp"><p>We ate our bento box lunch from the minshuku in the courtyard outside of Kumano Seiganto-ji. We had rice balls with ume, pickled veggies and salmon, plus fried pumpkin and fried fish cakes, and hard boiled egg. It was after 12pm and it felt like rain could start at any moment, so we put on our rain jackets at this point.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401907198" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-aH38t04ojkU/Vky3VUlu4aI/AAAAAAAAfXs/ibKT4X27duc/s288/P1490463.JPG" alt="20140604183958, "><span data-time="1401907198" class="timestamp"><p>We then entered the adjacent Kumano Nachi Taisha temple complex. These temples are painted bright orange. These Shinto temples were constructed around the worship of the grand waterfall.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401907894" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-DnPd9jrseiA/Vky3VTT-ekI/AAAAAAAAfXk/Hs6EuY0ICGc/s288/P1490473.JPG" alt="20140604185134, "><span data-time="1401907894" class="timestamp"><p>The one thing in this complex that caught my attention was a giant camphor tree. There was a tori gate at one side of the tree and we watched a woman pass through the gate, down a short flight of stairs and enter the inside of the tree through a hole in its base. Then, the woman climbed out of the mid section of the tree! Katrina and I were very intrigued and so we went down the stairs and into the tree ourselves. The core of the tree (in its lower portion) is hollow, and there is a metal staircase that leads from its base up about eight feet to its midsection. We climbed the stairs and exited onto a platform four feet above the ground. Katrina and I were reminded of a display we saw in Tokyo during our last trip to Japan. The display was encouraging people to explore nature, and it had a large stump constructed of cardboard that people could enter. The sign on the entrance to the stump said "Please enter this tree. It smell like tree and make you comfortable." Indeed, entering the camphor tree made us happy.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401908583" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-LpqjZnVRu5Y/Vky3VW_hzhI/AAAAAAAAfXs/7MJJbsdgTa8/s288/IMG_4460.JPG" alt="20140604190303, "><span data-time="1401908583" class="timestamp"><p>We descended the many staircases through Nachi-san and went back down Daimon-zaka too. It was after 1pm and the rain had still not started, so we decided to walk to our hotel on the coast. We started by walking through neighborhoods, which in Japanese style were full of modest sides houses set among terraced farmland. When the neighborhoods gave out, we walked along the main road and observed a large construction project to improve the banks of the river. (It seems that the Japanese are very proactive about infrastructure projects.) Eventually we made into Katsuura town, and walked along the quiet seafront highway until we came to our hotel, Katsuura Gyoen. I arrived a little miffed that it was passed 2pm and still no significant rain had fallen; we could have hiked the last segment of the Kumano Kodo hike today. On the other hand, we still did manage to walk 10.9 km today.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401917315" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-S8EDEvRL5NA/Vky3VR0TEbI/AAAAAAAAfXs/0Le_uqV-Avo/s288/P1490499.JPG" alt="20140604212835, "><span data-time="1401917315" class="timestamp"><p>Katsuura Gyoen is an imposing, blocky, 10 story concrete hotel on the waterfront. Katrina says she picked it because of its luxurious views of the Katsuura bay, but I am pretty sure she also thought this hulking hotel would also stand up to a tsunami. (We did pass several signs warning of tsunami danger and the expected height of water during a tsunami on our walk into town.) Regardless, we were asked to wait 30 minutes until 3pm and then were shown to our room, a 14 tatami mat space with a little enclosed porch that looks over the beautiful green bay and mountainous coast. The room smells of the tatami straw.</p><p>One of the hotel managers (perhaps one of the best English speakers here at the hotel) showed us around our room and told us how to use everything and what to expect for dinner and breakfast. He also gave us instructions for finding the hotel's onsen. He got down on his knees to bow to us as he left the room; he honestly could not have bowed any lower because the floor got in the way!</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401919585" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-8iRmJhYnUZY/Vky3VR1OsEI/AAAAAAAAfXk/9OET4XfW8fg/s288/P1490503.JPG" alt="20140604220625, "><span data-time="1401919585" class="timestamp"><p>With him was a lady dressed in traditional Japanese kamono. She showed us how to properly use the hotel provided robes and poured us some green tea. She spoke just a few words of English but we gathered that she would be back at 6:30pm to serve us our formal kaiseki dinner in our room.</p><p>We showered in our room before heading down to the 1st floor onsen. This is probably the last onsen of our trip, and actually is the first onsen in which we have encountered Japenese bathing too. For me, in the men's room, I entered the onsen's shower and hot spring bath room and found two other men present. By the time I had finished showering (trying to put on a good show of scrubbing to make sure they felt I was properly clean before entering the spa water) one of the men had left the onsen. It was raining and blustery outside, so I got in the swimming pool sized hot bath and soaked and stretched. The remaining Japanese man did come into the hot pool too, but we did not exchange any words and he actually only stayed in the water for a couple of minutes. I did see him though put his washcloth on the lip of the hot pool (I had my on my head as I had heard was done) so I mimicked this behavior after he left. The water was so hot that I could only stay in for about eight minutes, and I took a cold shower afterwards to prevent myself from leaving all overheated and sweating.</p><p>Ten minutes later I met Katrina in the hall and she told me about her onsen experience. There were ten or so women in women's onsen and she felt compelled to shower and scrub as long as the women next to her. Alas, after washing three times over, she gave up and left the shower area before the woman next to her had finished. She then went to the outside soaking pool (which on a clear day can see the Nachi-no-Otaki waterfall) and joined the pool with a gaggle of Japanese women. Kat says they tried to talk with her, but with so few words shared, the mainly figured out that Katrina was from California and did not get much further. After being in the pool for a while, Katrina said "hot-o, hot-o, sayonara" and left the pool! It sounds like she had a fun time!</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401919651" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-u2bMncy4Nns/Vky3VfAUZ7I/AAAAAAAAfXs/g7W48tHHuCI/s288/P1490506.JPG" alt="20140604220731, "><span data-time="1401919651" class="timestamp"><p>Back in the room we worked on a block puzzle that was provided by the hotel, then watched the rain and wind blow across the bay. At 6:40pm our kamono dressed hostess returned and we started dinner.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401933251" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-LP3Hlj_IcrY/Vky3Vd-O_AI/AAAAAAAAfXs/F_QRcrvpg9M/s288/P1490513.JPG" alt="20140605015411, "><span data-time="1401933251" class="timestamp"><p>As it was at the ryokans, dinner here was a multi-dish affair. We had steamed vegetables (which were steamed over chaffing candles at the table), salad, sesame tofu, green plum, yam, pickled beans, edamame, broccoli sprouts in manju, soba noodles, rice with fresh peas cooked at the table, dashi, jelly with carrots and squash, veggie tempura, tofu, eggplant with miso sauce, cheesecake in a cup, fresh loquat fruit, and nut paste with jello. The green plum and the eggplant with miso were my favorites. We also had a sake with the Kumano name. Just as with the manager who welcomed us to the hotel, whenever our hostess left the room to get us our next course she would do so with on the knees bowing.</p><p>The meal was very nice, though honestly the flavors were better last night and at our first ryokan of our hike. Still, it was quite an adventure to be served dinner in the room and to watch our hostess serve our food. We also enjoyed out struggle to communicate with us and for us to communicate with her.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401944743" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--b2ehAvpnBw/Vky3VffW7lI/AAAAAAAAfXs/C3XYTTvfAxg/s288/P1490539.JPG" alt="20140605050543, "><span data-time="1401944743" class="timestamp"><p>After dinner other hotel staff came into our room, moved the tables aside and made our beds. They also put an air freshener in the outlet to remove the scents from dinner.

<h2><a id="Philly to Bamberg">Philly to Bamberg</a></h2><h3><a id="1362816000">03/09/2013</a></h3><p>(Preamble - Friday March 8, 2013)</p><p>We were picked up this afternoon at 3pm by Mr. K. Mr K. had taken off from work early and had taken Mrs K's Durango in order to be able to haul us and our stuff to the airport. This was a rather kind act on both of their parts, as it meant an extra hour of driving for Mr K and a walk to work for Mrs K. Considering that it was busy snowing this morning, I felt pretty guilty about causing Mrs K to go without her car!</p><p>We went first to Megan's apartment on the far side of Bryn Mawr campus, and collected her and her luggage. It appears that Megan packed as much for herself as Katrina and I did for the two of us :-). Kat and I tried to restrict our packing, as we have a transfer in Zurich and were under the impression that our carry-on bag can weigh no more that 18lbs.</p><p>The trip to the airport was quick and uneventful, and we said thanks and goodbye to Mr K at 3:30pm and headed into the terminal. The security line was very short (yay!). Megan and our flights left from different wings of Terminal 1, so we did not wait with each other. Megan is flying nonstop to Munich; we are flying first to Zurich and then to Frankfurt.</p><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1362814148" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-GXKe-RtJslY/ViFhc7R1C5I/AAAAAAAAKFc/UI0HmrYNqwg/s288/IMG_20130308_172908.jpg" alt="20130309072908, "><span data-time="1362814148" class="timestamp"><p>Our flight USAir 710 left at 6:05pm. The plane was an older 767. Katrina and I had a nice pair of aisle and window seats to share. We were also within good viewing distance of the movie screen (no in-seat entertainment systems for us!) and watched the TV show How I Met Your Mother and James Bond's Skyfall in the first hours of the flight. For dinner service we had a cream sauce pasta plate with intsy-tinsy salads. We both tried to find a happy sleeping position in our seats, but mostly failed. I am sure I slept some, but it sure was not much!</p><p>Saturday March 9, 2013</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1362846706" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-8wkzZWpOzuU/Vhgb3nDDIkI/AAAAAAAAKDY/HQ3L4D8TRgE/s288/P1400491.JPG" alt="20130309163146, "><span data-time="1362846706" class="timestamp"><p>When I did wake up it was day again and we were getting close to Zurich. I opened the window shades and soon Katrina was saying that she could see the Alps out of the windows. It took me a while to process, the scene, as the snow-covered alps started down below the patchy cloud cover and then rose up piercing the clouds and reaching into the sky above. It was really really beautiful! The Alps are one of my favorite mountain ranges (actually, they probably are my favorite) and I have never seen them in the winter. The lowland countryside is actually clear of snow and is more or less green. Patches of woods, farmland and concentrated villages define the landscape.</p><p>We circled around Zurich before landing at 9am. This was 1 hour later than the scheduled arrival time! We had about 1 hour before our flight, or about 30 minutes before our boarding. Right off the jetway we started rushing to the next terminal. Our first step was to clear the security checkpoint, which actually had built a long line. Halfheartedly we tried to ease our way to the front. A fellow traveler behind us encouraged us forward when she heard that we were late for our flight. Eventually, we just cut the whole line and made our way straight to the X-ray machine.</p><p>We had to pull out all of our electronics, our belts, our liquids. It turned out that the EU restrictions on liquids is stricter than in the US, and so we were chided on our too large baggies and were handed a 1 liter bag for our next flight. Katrina had to discard some of her overage liquids.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1362850033" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-nu_YJjxJHDM/ViFhc7rFK-I/AAAAAAAAKFg/WxW-nMbK30M/s288/IMG_20130309_032713.jpg" alt="20130309172713, "><span data-time="1362850033" class="timestamp"><p>Rushing away from security we ran up to customs. There was no line at this point, and we went straight for the first customs booth. The man behind the counter cheerfully admonished us for using the EU only line, but still stamped our passports and let us through. We ran from the customs all the way to the gate, which appeared mostly empty. I went straight to the airline rep and asked if the flight had left. "No," she said, "boarding has not yet started."</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1362852105" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-DmH29vdYEd8/ViF0MUN1iiI/AAAAAAAAKkw/IEiqyOOi51M/s288/IMG_8706.JPG" alt="20130309180145, "><span data-time="1362852105" class="timestamp"><p>Flight 1185 at 9:50am to Frankfurt was just 40 minutes long. I was hoping we would have more chances to see and photograph the Alps, but we were on the wrong side of the plane and actually the Alps disappeared after 10 minutes anyway.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1362858110" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Vr3mm2LbQfY/Vhgb__HRZ7I/AAAAAAAAHdE/4zy1F_CTvO4/s288/P1400505.JPG" alt="20130309194150, "><span data-time="1362858110" class="timestamp"><p>We landed in Frankfurt, deplaned onto a bus and then were unloaded at Terminal 1. This was perfect, as T1 was the location of our Europcar rental. Figuring this was our best chance to get a bite to eat, we found a small cafe Beyond in the terminal area and had a little breakfast of fruit and yogurt. We then exited the terminal, journeyed through the rail station mall and found the rental car.</p><p>Our car is a brand new (just 200km on the odometer) BMW 320d xDrive. This means it has a mid sized diesel engine with AWD. It also is fully equipped with the sports line package, navigation (making yesterday's investment in an Android GPS app unnecessary), head up display, moonroof, and a 6 speed manual.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1362858128" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-OXvojoBvo48/VhgcBSd3fdI/AAAAAAAAHdU/FLNykmeu_Gs/s288/P1400507.JPG" alt="20130309194208, "><span data-time="1362858128" class="timestamp"><p>We did a walk around of the car looking for preexisting damage (there are some scrapes on top of the trunk), then switched the nav into English mode and hit the road.</p><p>It was a quick shot out of the airport complex to the A3 autobahn. The head up display gave me the distance and instruction for the next turn, and also displays the speed limit for the current road. Within a few minutes the coveted end-of-restrictions sign appeared, meaning there was no more speed limit!</p><p>I worked my way up in comfort, starting with 150kph, then cruising at 160kph for while and finding the car settles in quite comfortably at 180kph (~110mph). The car has quick steering off response as you turn off center, and at first this caused me to sway around in the lane. I became used to the steering speed in short time. Per German regulations, the car is shod in snow tires as it is before March 15, and as I continued exploring higher speeds, they seemed to get less and less comfortable with the task. This was particularly noticeable at 200kph or so. The diesel engine revs to 5k (or so) but after 4k it is really time to shift. The engine is very very unhappy at the top of its rev range. Even though the car is geared long, I could basically just stay in 6th for all of the autobahn strafing, as there is plenty of torque to pull you from 100kph onwards.</p><p>I was grinning for the first 45 minutes or more, wishing autobahns would exist in America too. This is just so damn cool!</p><p>I was one of the faster cars on the road, but certainly not the fastest. I think I may have miffed the driver of a silver Mercedes C-class, who was behind me at a respectable distance for 5 minutes or so. When I finally did pull right to let him by, he absolutely flew past! He also waved a hand in the rear window - either he was thanking me for letting him past or giving me the bird!</p><p>Closing in on Bamberg the car's HUD showed a warning sign that an accident was ahead on the road. Sure enough, a few minutes later the traffic drew to a halt. Some poor fellow had put his car into both the left and right guard rails, and his car was blocking the left lane. He seemed to be OK, as he and his family had spread out a picnic blanket on the edge of the highway and were talking with Polizei.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1362864940" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-GvxisXPDbB4/ViF0MS7mtaI/AAAAAAAAKkw/-L76y81ka3M/s288/IMG_8712.JPG" alt="20130309213540, "><span data-time="1362864940" class="timestamp"><p>We exited the highway and took smaller roads through agricultural towns to Bamberg. Along the way we spotted out first schloss, and also several picturesque villages too. My reading of German road rules and signage was very helpful in helping us anticipate and decipher the rules, markings and signs of the road. The main difference is that there is a very precise idea of right-of-way, in which certain priority roads are marked as having right-of-way over minor intersecting roads.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1362869419" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SeVYPGcgpaY/VhgcE0dpofI/AAAAAAAAHd8/rBpgJ_1Y7WE/s288/P1400515.JPG" alt="20130309225019, "><span data-time="1362869419" class="timestamp"><p>After maybe 1.5 or 2 hours of travel we arrived at Megan and Ethan's home. They let us in and showed us around our their spacious place. The place has 2 bedrooms and 2 baths, plus lots of sunroom space. The house has lots of tile flooring, and lots of exposed wood cabinetry and ceilings. Also intriguing is the old tile furnace in the entry way with painted ceramic tiles.</p><p>While Megan and Ethan when for a run, Katrina and I showered and recomposed ourselves.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1362874082" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-jhjhCew423A/VhgccJlwuvI/AAAAAAAAHhM/cnFOx_DVlBc/s288/P1400544.JPG" alt="20130310000802, "><span data-time="1362874082" class="timestamp"><p>Once everyone was back, Ethan drove us around old and new Bamberg in his 335i. We first skirted the walls of the old city and peered into the main church square. Then we drove down to the river front and checked out the river front houses, which are directly on the water and very picturesque. We drove back into the old city and up to the base of the cathedral/old church. We then headed back to the river and parked next to the tourist information building. Old Bamberg is all stone walls and stone buildings, and feels very medieval. Surrounding it is a slightly newer town, with still very old plaster with murals buildings spread along the river and onto a sizable island in the river. Several building are build in the river itself, diverting the flow around their bases.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1362876098" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-5vSQb9LNoJY/ViF0MSelBbI/AAAAAAAAKkw/L-AqpSwmZWc/s288/IMG_8718.JPG" alt="20130310004138, "><span data-time="1362876098" class="timestamp"><p>We walked over the bridges to the island, and found a late lunch at a spaggheteria, near the university. Katrina and I shared a salad and a risotto. Over lunch I got to learn a little bit about Ethan, who is a lawyer here on the local army base. Ethan has done a bit of day tripping around Bamberg, and had some suggestions of things for us to visit during our stay.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1362882384" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-fUpRyqeQxBY/ViFhc6BxlTI/AAAAAAAAKFY/kvdnHhPNSdg/s288/IMG_20130309_122624.jpg" alt="20130310022624, "><span data-time="1362882384" class="timestamp"><p>We left downtown and drove back to Ethan's neighborhood to do a little shopping. First stop was the Lidl liquor store, to buy beer. Beer is sold in glass bottle by the bottle or by a crate of 20. The pricing is less than 90 cents per bottle - and even a good portion of that cost can be recovered it you return your empty bottles after the fact. Ethan went and picked out a few of his favorite makes for us to try later. Kat and I looked to see if we could find a local wine. Strangely, none of the wines cost much more than 9 Euros, We finally found a 15 euro Franconia wine which we decided to try.</p><p>For groceries we went to the adjacent Rewe. This feels a bit like a typical small Shaws. We got supplies for breakfast including yogurt, muesli, eggs, cheese, fruit and tea. I tried to use my credit card in the swipe reader at the check out out success, but the checkout girl was able to make it work with a series of button presses and swipes that I will not be able to reproduce!</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1362885301" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-vsxqiCDT6pU/ViFhc7UV1HI/AAAAAAAAKFY/WQKCvf_0lE8/s288/IMG_20130309_131501.jpg" alt="20130310031501, "><span data-time="1362885301" class="timestamp"><p>We came home and Ethan poured us tastes of 3 beers. We all liked the first beer the best, a Marzen smoked beer which ended in a series of flavors reminiscent of pretzels. Katrina and I don't drink beers, yet we both found this one interesting and flavorful. The other two beers also had wide series of flavors with each sip, but were not as tasty to us.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1362888831" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ilXVJ3OsZi0/ViFhc1Qaq3I/AAAAAAAAKFg/_Hqru_8ARbg/s288/IMG_20130309_141351.jpg" alt="20130310041351, "><span data-time="1362888831" class="timestamp"><p>Around 8pm, Ethan's friends and coworkers Scott and Tim arrived - Tim with his wife Annalisa - to join us for dinner. We all put on our shoes (most of us slightly dressed up for the evening) and Took the hiking path up the hill to the Schloss Altenburg which overlooks all of Bamberg. Ethan and Scott lit the way with their cellphones, trying to guide us around muddy sections of the trail. No one slipped or otherwise misstepped, and throughout the whole hike we could see the schloss high above, lit against the night sky. It is quite a way to go to dinner! The tall castle walls are also very imposing and made you wonder about those unwelcome visitors who might have attempted to scale them under opposition.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1362892634" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7-lJCgYK8FM/ViFhc17YGTI/AAAAAAAAKFg/zO3RBJgW9Ng/s288/IMG_20130309_151714.jpg" alt="20130310051714, "><span data-time="1362892634" class="timestamp"><p>We entered the castle through the high drawbridge over the dry moat, and found the restaurant Altenburg in the first building to the right of the gate. Only two other tables were occupied, both by older couple dressed in evening jackets. Were we underdressed? The waiter encouraged us to order soon, as the kitchen would close soon. Katrina and I tried a wild mushroom and fried bread dumpling dish, plus a ravioli entree. The mushroom dish was very good and reminded me of the "breadballs" I was served at every meal when I was in Austria with the Morris family. Hopefully I won't be eating this dish quite so frequently, so I can enjoy it every time. The other dinners enjoyed their lamb and pork greatly. Good company, good food, and an exceptional setting made dinner quite an event.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1362896387" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-HustMO5U5VA/ViFhc-c6sAI/AAAAAAAAKFY/xwKLDIowL6k/s288/IMG_20130309_161947.jpg" alt="20130310061947, "><span data-time="1362896387" class="timestamp"><p>After dinner we walked home on the road, so as to avoid the muddy path and a potential downhill tumble. We walked down towards the center of town, looking over the old Dom cathedral, which curiously is unlit in the evenings. Our path wound through the edge of town, through neighborhoods like Ethan's with separated houses and also through more urban residential areas where the houses join each other. The town feels safe and clean even at night.</p><p>Back at the house, we bid everyone goodnight and retired for the evening.</p><span id="endOfEntry"><p>&lt;End of Journal&gt;</p></span></span>

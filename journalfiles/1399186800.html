The breakfast spread was quite extensive and nice - Nepali dishes alongside yogurt, pastry, omelets, fruit and sushi. I enjoyed the meal and also the beautiful garden space onto which we looked.</p><p>We went back to our room for a short bit in which I washed some clothes in the sink. I have been hand washing socks and underwear each day, but to day I decided to give my shirts a wash too.</p><p>At 10am we met with our head guide for the Peregrine tour to give him some of our travel documents. His name is Tilak (said Tee-luc) and he is maybe 30 years old, short and powerfully built. He seems a nice guy though we were having a little bit of language difficulties understanding everything he was trying to tell us.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399232855" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Df265LDGK9I/U_bFsar0H0I/AAAAAAAAAew/FhN7SZFJjiA/s288/IMG_2449.JPG" alt="20140504194735, "><span data-time="1399232855" class="timestamp"><p>After our meeting we decided to head out on foot for Thamil, one of the heavily touristed neighborhoods of Kathmandu. We walked south along the main road on which our hotel is located for about 15 minutes. This road is two lanes in each direction and lined with stores and hotels. The road was covered in a thick dust (which must be brought onto the road surface from people pulling on from unpaved driveways and side streets) and the traffic was lifting the dust in to the air and mixing it with exhaust fumes to form a nasty brew which my lungs did not appreciate. This area reminds me a bit of Tijuana for its dustiness, trash on the street and sidewalk, and buildings in half completed states of construction. On the other hand, the tangles of telephone and electrical wires which droop down from the utility poles and graze the sidewalks plus the unceasing flow of honking moped and bus traffic reminds me of Hanoi. The pedestrian crossing method of bravely stepping out into the street and dodging cars definitely reminds me of Hanoi. There are no stop lights here so playing Frogger is the only way to cross.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399235311" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-xZ8AobdEWyE/U_bFwAj6JbI/AAAAAAAAAfM/V4m6qdAX5DM/s288/IMG_2453.JPG" alt="20140504202831, "><span data-time="1399235311" class="timestamp"><p>We survived a few street crossings of our own and eventually made it to Thamil. Thamil is a warren of crooked streets which are lined with tourist shops (lots of trekking gear is available), hotels, and restaurants. There are no sidewalks here so you walk on the edge of the road and hope a passing taxi or moped does not take you out. Passing vehicles (kindly?) honk at you as they approach to dissuade you from stepping into their path. Multistory brick or plaster buildings with ground floor retail shops form the streets edges. We found it easy to lose our place in this maze of a neighborhood, but we quickly learned not to stay put looking at our map for too long as it invited the many tour hawkers to "come to our rescue" before trying to sell us on a tour. Taxis and bike rickshaws were also very interested in giving us a ride.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399241974" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-yzk0qEAXuMs/U_bGOflgXUI/AAAAAAAAAh0/6KNDXxRbhow/s288/IMG_2473.JPG" alt="20140504221934, "><span data-time="1399241974" class="timestamp"><p>After wandering around for an hour, getting lost and getting found, seeing a few shrines in intersections and breathing a many more loads of dirt, dust, and exhaust, I was ready to call it quits and head back to the hotel. Katrina however talked me into finding a calm restaurant courtyard for lunch (meals here are really cheap, maybe $15 feeds two people) where we relaxed, used the WiFi, and recuperated.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399244776" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-pgFEcDU5Cos/U_dDcHkJOdI/AAAAAAAACT4/1YAyYgfa-xg/s288/P1450733.JPG" alt="20140504230616, "><span data-time="1399244776" class="timestamp"><p>Re-emboldened, we set out after lunch for Dubar Square. This was another 15 minutes south, and took us out of Thamil with its hiking gear and tourist shops into a new neighborhood with fabric stores and pharmacies. Unsurprisingly considering how brilliantly Nepali women dress (think of Indian dress and you have the right picture), the fabric stores are riots of color and are fun to peer into while passing by.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399245535" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-U3uuSNw4uRA/U_dDdLrhevI/AAAAAAAACUI/VNIGHr67Hto/s288/P1450739.JPG" alt="20140504231855, "><span data-time="1399245535" class="timestamp"><p>Dunbar Square is a historic temple and palace compound. The temples are of the stacked pagoda variety, and the palace is grand structure with beautiful carved woodwork adorning the doors, walls and columns. We went inside the palace courtyards and took many minutes soaking up the detail work. Basically the palace felt like an Alhambra made of wood rather than plaster.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399247248" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-sZ9BkQBwWww/U_dDpcRUgmI/AAAAAAAACWw/bn-diHw3j9g/s288/P1450765.JPG" alt="20140504234728, "><span data-time="1399247248" class="timestamp"><p>We started ascending the Nine Stories Palace tower when the skies broke open and rain began fall heavily. We are on the edge of the monsoon season here in Nepal, so storms are to be expected. It was wonderful watching the rainstorm from high up in the palace tower. All the dirt and dust in the air and on the ground was tamped down, though some of it was converted into muddy puddles. After about 30 minutes the rain slowed, and beautiful vistas across Dunbar Square and Kathmandu as a whole opened up. This city is such a strange landscape of haphazard construction, temple towers, utility wires, and colorful pedestrians! Katrina says it is the most foreign place she has ever been; it is certainly in contention for that for me too.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399250068" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-5DjpLFlFw-w/U_bHwsvqpdI/AAAAAAAAAp4/hp2lclZ1jXo/s288/IMG_2542.JPG" alt="20140505003428, "><span data-time="1399250068" class="timestamp"><p>We left Dunbar Square and started heading north back towards Thamil and our hotel. I was very much enjoying being able to breathe clean air as we passed more brightly colored sari shops and fabric shops. Most Nepali women wear western clothing, but a good 25% or so wear bright saris. I have been noticing that the Nepalese faces sometimes look Asian/Tibetan to me and some times look Indian to me. I suppose that Nepal is positioned between these two locations, so there is probably a good ethnic mix here. The food we have seen seems to fall more in line with Indian food though.</p><p>Then the sound of thunder occurred again and the rain started to fall anew. Most people ran to hide under doorways or shop overhangs. A few school children bolted passed us presumably trying to get home as quickly as possible! (School kids here wear uniforms; the boys wear ties.) People were smiling and laughing as they rushed out of the rain and into temporary shelter.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399251404" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-wySxfm-HRJQ/U_dECSEDuII/AAAAAAAACbQ/nkTxteGrCAA/s288/P1450833.JPG" alt="20140505005644, "><span data-time="1399251404" class="timestamp"><p>We hid in a few different doorways as the rain ebbed and flowed and we continued our journey north. At one point in the square at the south end of Thamil Marg our northbound progress was blocked by massive puddles which had flooded the street. We did a roundabout detour to the south to avoid soaking our shoes in the questionable water - we have been told that all water here in Kathmandu is a health hazard. Our return via Lazimpat Rd was also exciting because the buses and motorcycles were kicking up big waves of dirty puddle water onto the sidewalks.</p><p>We did make it back to the hotel at about 4:30pm, and at 5pm we met with our trekking group for the Annapurna hike. The five other trekkers are Australians, and they seem to know each other. It turns out there will be seven staff on this hike too, which seems excessive! We were given guidance on what to pack, how much cash to bring, and how to tip.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399262512" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-cVIEK8V8rsM/U_dEDaQ2kaI/AAAAAAAACbk/i-NUltwx8Q0/s288/P1450835.JPG" alt="20140505040152, "><span data-time="1399262512" class="timestamp"><p>Katrina and I skipped the group dinner and instead braved another street crossing to go to Bhumi restaurant for a Nepali sampler plate dinner. We were pleased with our meal - I particularly liked the fried momo balls. We had been concerned about our ability to cross the street back to the hotel after dark, but thankfully there was an immediate opening in the traffic for us to exploit, and we made it back safely.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399262836" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-AT6XD9akTIE/U_dEEjggIII/AAAAAAAACcw/87yl9p8pgmM/s288/P1450838.JPG" alt="20140505040716, "><span data-time="1399262836" class="timestamp"><p id="endOfEntry">&lt;End of Journal&gt;</p></span>

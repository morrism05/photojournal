<h2><a id="Chiang Mai">Chiang Mai</a></h2><h3><a id="1400310000">05/17/2014</a></h3><p>Wow! What a fantastic day!</p><p>Today we had breakfast at the hotel as usual (french toast was available instead of waffles). It was raining pretty steadily and the temperature was nice as a result. We waited for the van to the Patara Elephant Farm to pick us up. The van was 15 minutes later than its 7:30am schedule, but we piled in, stopped at two more hotels, then drove 45 minutes out of town and into the hills and jungle to the farm. The rain had stopped by the time we arrived.</p><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400342134" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-MUybE0az3cU/ViJ6XOC4qkI/AAAAAAAAUOc/5L5oAL_K34o/s288/P1470118.JPG" alt="20140517155534, "><span data-time="1400342134" class="timestamp"><p>Upon arrival at the farm, we immediately had our first contact with the elephants. Two mothers and two babies were being fed tall grass shoots in a field by a river, and we milled around with these four elephants for 30 minutes, patting them and taking pictures.</p><p>Eventually one of the guides gathered us together and explained the philosophy of the farm. The farm has 52 elephants or so and it cares for them, keeps them healthy and introduces them to tourists. Each elephant has his or her own trainer who is with the elephant for all days of the month but two. The elephants have a regular routine of feeding, getting their health checked, walking in the jungle and bathing. Each of us would be an interim caretaker for the day and help an elephant through these activities.</p><p>Our big group was then split into two smaller groups and was taken to different parts of the farm for an introduction to our elephant for the day. Our group had eight people, me and Katrina, a young French couple, a woman from SF, a woman from Brazil, and two lady friends from Europe.</p><p>We were each paired with a different elephant supposedly based on our temperament and how we'd jive with the elephant's temperament, though the reasons for the pairing were not explained. I was paired with Mae Boon Tong and her trainer. Mae Boon Tong is a 38 year old female elephant. She is mostly dark skinned, but has some pink coloring on her nose and ears. She also has a bit of bristly hair on her head and back. Mae Boon Tong was one of seven adult female elephants - four of the other females had babies following them around which they were still nursing. (I had expected elephant teats to be in the location of cow udders, but in fact elephants, like humans, have two teats between their front legs.)</p><p>The one adult male of about 20 years old (and the biggest elephant too!) was Bu Jaan, and he was paired with Katrina. Kat looked a little incredulous about the idea of riding bareback on the biggest elephant of the group but she did not make a fuss.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400347843" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-M_BbposSKyk/ViJ6XGJWedI/AAAAAAAAUOc/jSuvdiZvvKY/s288/P1470151.JPG" alt="20140517173043, "><span data-time="1400347843" class="timestamp"><p>Our first interactions with our elephants was to greet them and feed them. We each took a basket of bananas, tamarind, and sugar cane and went over to the elephant. We would hold up a food item near the elephant's eyes and say "bo". Then we would put our hand out and the elephant would put its mouth around our hand and take the food item. We would pat the elephant on the cheek and say "di di" to indicate she was doing a good job. I never felt any teeth, so I guess my hand was just being covered in elephant lips! The trainer for Mae Boon Tong did not speak much English, but he indicated that the her teeth are further back in her mouth. (My trainer also had a nasty cold and kept blowing his nose into his hand and hocking loogies onto the ground.)</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400348757" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Vg_0U31HFuQ/ViJ6XPzkk2I/AAAAAAAAUOY/DtVNS3_rVn8/s288/P1470171.JPG" alt="20140517174557, "><span data-time="1400348757" class="timestamp"><p>When I ran out of food in my basket (and my hand was covered in elephant slobber) Mae Boon Tong turned her attention back to the tall-grass food she had been eating prior and I was taken away to learn a bit more about caring for elephants. Katrina and Bu Jaan were made the example for this instruction. First, we were told how to tell if our elephant was at ease by looking to see if the elephant was flapping its ears and wagging its tail. If the ears are straight out and not moving then the elephant is at alert and maybe we should not approach.</p><p>The next thing we were taught was to see if the elephant was sleeping well. Healthy elephants sleep 45 minutes on one side, stand for 15 minutes to relax and then do another 45min/15min cycle on some other side so as not to strain their bodies with having all their weight on one side all night. The elephant will get a total of 4 or 5 hours of sleep each night this way. If the elephant is sick it will not roll over much or maybe not even sleep. By looking at the dirt on the elephant's body in the morning we can see if it slept on all sides.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400349159" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-vKZx7mE1Suc/VikEldG70kI/AAAAAAAAbeU/zZLtDerQ3Qg/s288/IMG_1242.JPG" alt="20140517175239, "><span data-time="1400349159" class="timestamp"><p>The third health item was to check if the elephant was perspiring well. Elephants only sweat at their cuticles.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400349325" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--Bp9LlnZbf8/VikElbvSynI/AAAAAAAAbeQ/BlFNFHe8QbI/s288/IMG_1245.JPG" alt="20140517175525, "><span data-time="1400349325" class="timestamp"><p>The final health check was to check the elephant's dung. Katrina and her handler went off to find some of Bu Jaan's dung, and the handler tried to have her carry back a soccer-ball sized poo but she was not willing! The handler brought it back himself and broke it open. We were shown how it was mostly just straw (and mostly smelled like straw too) and more or less looks like horse manure. If the elephant had good teeth, then the straw would be broken into little bits. Otherwise you might find whole leaves in the poo which would be a bad sign as the food would not be getting digested well. Next, if the poo was sticky like human or dog poo that was also a bad sign. Finally, the guide wrung out some of the poo and showed us how it contained water. Dry poo without any is a sign of a dehydrated elephant. The last point was that a healthy elephant would have dropped more than five balls of poo when it goes.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400349718" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-QUwcnizBsf4/VikElTVbfyI/AAAAAAAAbeU/KOqFFUiyzZw/s288/IMG_1256.JPG" alt="20140517180158, "><span data-time="1400349718" class="timestamp"><p>We all went off to our own elephants to look for the health signs. My handler did not do the poo checks with me. Instead we took Mae Boon Tong over to a hose and washed her down in preparation for a ride.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400352730" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-xX8vWpxi_b0/VikElfrI67I/AAAAAAAAbeU/WqnwCCSL6Vg/s288/IMG_1377.JPG" alt="20140517185210, "><span data-time="1400352730" class="timestamp"><p>We were told about the three ways to mount our elephant. In way #1 the elephant crooks its front leg and you climb up with one foot on the elephant's foot, one foot on the elephant's knee and then grab the neck and upper ear and pull yourself up. Way #2 the elephant lowers its head and lays out its nose like a carpet. You step on the upper nose and grab the top of its head. The elephant lifts its head bringing you level with its back so you can scramble on board (facing backwards!). Way #3 is where the elephant lays down for you completely and you climb aboard.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400352986" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-co_G5egkv9g/VikElfrrBcI/AAAAAAAAbeQ/rB-v5Vetb8E/s288/IMG_1390.JPG" alt="20140517185626, "><span data-time="1400352986" class="timestamp"><p>With Mae Boon Tong I used way #1 and hauled myself onto her back. Then I was instructed to move forward onto her big neck (this part is as big as a horse itself), tuck up my legs so that my shins were up against where her ears meet her head, and hold on to either the top of her head or to the rope they put around her chest and back. Having my legs pinned behind Mae Boon Tong's ears worked pretty well, as she could continue to flap her ears and I had two good points of contact to stabilize myself. Sitting on her neck was mostly comfortable, as the neck moves less than the back as she walks, but Mae Boon Tong had bristly hair of about 3 inches in length which poked up through the riding pants they gave me and dug into my legs. (It was not too bad!) I rode with my left hand on the top of her head and my right hand reaching back and grabbing the rope for stability.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400353431" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-yXa061IYU5g/VikElTjeGbI/AAAAAAAAbeQ/Mxq3ajDXkI4/s288/IMG_1417.JPG" alt="20140517190351, "><span data-time="1400353431" class="timestamp"><p>Once everyone was mounted, the guides lead us and our elephants into the jungle, up and over a hill and to a river. The ride was very curious, swaying back and forth 7 feet above the ground, having elephant bristles sticking into my legs, feeling the heat of Mae Boon Tong's ears against my legs, smelling her almost dog-like smell. Mae did a fine job of avoiding tossing me from her neck or ramming me into a tree or an overhead branch. Mostly we went along at a doddle, but sometimes the trainer would coerce her into a spirited walk. I started out the trip in front of the pack but was passed by other pairs along the way. The four babies ran along with the group too. I had a permanent smile on for the duration of the ride.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400356189" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-FLGC0OhaST8/ViJ6XB8MWWI/AAAAAAAAUOc/tlQ7HvURnaw/s288/P1470194.JPG" alt="20140517194949, "><span data-time="1400356189" class="timestamp"><p>When we made it to the river I dismounted (over the forehead and down the trunk) and we were told we were going to wash our elephants. Everyone stripped down to their bathing suits. In the mean time the elephants had waded straight into the river and were busy submersing themselves in the pool, drinking from the upstream waterfall and (for the babies) rough-housing in the water. We followed them into the water and our trainers showed us how to scrub the elephant's body with firm strong strokes of a wash brush. We also had a basket which we could use to apply more water to the animal.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400356956" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-pZzQ88FoCww/VikElaFDwlI/AAAAAAAAbeQ/z6XPBkwUZZo/s288/IMG_1670.JPG" alt="20140517200236, "><span data-time="1400356956" class="timestamp"><p>Mae Boon Tong was over at the upstream end of the pool (near Bu Jaan) and so I went over and was instructed by the trainer to climb back on her neck and start scrubbing. I did so - she was about 75% submerged for most of this process - and scrubbed what I could reach from my location. This meant I mostly got some of her head, ears, neck and upper back. Mae would roll from side to side every so often, and I would have to skooch myself over to the left or the right to remain upright. We also had to be careful that our legs would not be pinched between two elephants or between an elephant and a rock as they moved. This bathing with elephants was probably the most fun part of the day! They really loved the water and would even keep there noses underwater for minutes at a time.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400357563" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-wAc0VXsF5_A/VikEleloNGI/AAAAAAAAbeQ/ZcW1k2R5kAs/s288/IMG_1741.JPG" alt="20140517201243, "><span data-time="1400357563" class="timestamp"><p>Eventually the trainers moved the elephants to the shallow end of the pool, and we did more scrubbing and rinsing of the elephants from on foot. Mae Boon Tong actually has some pretty pink colored skin when she is clean. I spent a good time scrubbing her trunk and looking her in the eye at this point. It felt pretty touching to me; I don't know what she thought of it though!</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400357884" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-iALBU9VGx00/VikElbpVorI/AAAAAAAAbeU/OiqN4JzWJAM/s288/IMG_1791.JPG" alt="20140517201804, "><span data-time="1400357884" class="timestamp"><p>We took a round of group photos while in the pool with the elephants, then we were shown to a bamboo platform where we had our lunch. Patara provided many banana leaf wrapped rice dishes including fried rice and sticky rice with egg custard, and coconut and fruit bites (cakes?), and finally lots and lots of exotic fruits to try. I enjoyed the food, but unfortunately my insect repellent had been washed off by the bathing and I got five mosquito bites at the beginning of lunch.</p><p>After lunch we rode our elephants a short way back to the vans (I mounted via way #2 this time) and said goodbye to the elephants and trainers. We were driven back to Chiang Mai by the head guide and dropped off at The Small hotel. We have a souvenir DVD of photos from the day.</p><p>We spent a good deal of time washing our clothes and cleaning ourselves too. Then, around 6:30pm, we headed out into Chiang Mai to find dinner.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400380229" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-g5l2iXH4PdI/ViJ6XL6liEI/AAAAAAAAUOc/-lYNeobeav4/s288/P1470198.JPG" alt="20140518023029, "><span data-time="1400380229" class="timestamp"><p>We went to Aum Vegetarian Cafe which is on the edge of the old city which is closest to our hotel. Their khosoi house curry was very tasty and we also liked their spicy green papaya salad. Their stir fried veggies tasted like Chinese food. Aum Cafe is part restaurant and part book store, with lots of used books on shelves.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400383008" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-A9I8NuH1Pmw/ViJ6XHgRjcI/AAAAAAAAUOY/v2dzRdkD370/s288/P1470201.JPG" alt="20140518031648, "><span data-time="1400383008" class="timestamp"><p>We walked to the walking market, another night market at which local vendors sell food and crafts. We walked about half of the stalls (the market goes on and on). There were lots of textiles, carvings, and food. We saw one young woman buying cooked insects as a snack. This was clearly a novelty item, but she was very positive about eating the fried grubs and tried to convince us to buy some. We did not. (They were also selling cicadas to eat.)</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400383741" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-hBextKrHs5A/ViJ6XJF917I/AAAAAAAAUOc/IVLTJUoyAZ0/s288/P1470203.JPG" alt="20140518032901, "><span data-time="1400383741" class="timestamp"><p>We walked back to the hotel via a corner of the old city, passing many guesthouses and bars. I noticed that most of the bars have a pool table.</p><p id="endOfEntry">&lt;End of Journal&gt;</p></span>

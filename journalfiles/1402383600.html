<h2><a id="Kyoto">Kyoto</a></h2><h3><a id="1402383600">06/10/2014</a></h3><p>We got up early today, cooked eggs in the room plus had some yogurt with bananas too, then got on a bus at about 8am for Arashiama. Arashiama is a neighborhood in northeastern Kyoto with many fabulous temples and sites.</p><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402415568" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-sd4XF9Vb69M/Vky2WDyx7uI/AAAAAAAAfbo/ePI7zPj-nN4/s288/P1500117.JPG" alt="20140610155248, "><span data-time="1402415568" class="timestamp"><p>It was a one hour bus ride to our destination and we entered Tenryu-ji temple shortly after its opening. Tenryu-ji is one of Kyoto's UNESCO sites. We were not the only people present at this time of day, but we were some of the few. The primary attraction at Tenryu-ji is its Sogen Garden. The garden is set around a large pond, and several peninsulas and small islands protrude into the water. On the near bank was a raked rock garden, one of many we would see today. There were some azaleas and lilies in bloom around the pond, brightening the view.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402416687" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-epfiX6Kf9aU/Vky2WIpbbxI/AAAAAAAAfbg/SDSb3xf7J-U/s288/P1500138.JPG" alt="20140610161127, "><span data-time="1402416687" class="timestamp"><p>On the backside of the pond we walked through some forest paths, with green moss as ground cover. The gardeners were out with whisk brooms and dust pans sweeping up the needles and leaves which had fallen onto the moss. I'll admit that the moss is much more attractive when swept!</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402417608" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Ctr-SrcwBc8/Vky2WE_nHoI/AAAAAAAAfV0/uDRUWPiIoGI/s288/IMG_4810.JPG" alt="20140610162648, "><span data-time="1402417608" class="timestamp"><p>We checked out the temples in Tenryu-ji too, but they were mainly nice for having the same views onto the gardens that we had seen from the garden path. There was one unique view of a stream in an interior courtyard which was a nice bonus.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402419431" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-2ba8_RC2p9I/Vky2WBa2w9I/AAAAAAAAfV0/7iWSFpQWi7g/s288/IMG_4835.JPG" alt="20140610165711, "><span data-time="1402419431" class="timestamp"><p>We exited Tenryu-ji via its north entrance, which is also the sight of Arashiama's bamboo grove. Though the bamboo may look blue in my photos, it is actually green. The shoots are probably 8" in diameter and 30' tall. We walked the short street through the grove. (I was surprised that taxis were driving the street.) The street was wider and shorter than I had imagined, just two blocks long with a slight s-turn in the middle. Finding a time to take a photo without other people in the background was a trick!</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402420594" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_C9PY-nLabw/Vky2WFYqFtI/AAAAAAAAfbQ/iI1g_187qXI/s288/P1500175.JPG" alt="20140610171634, "><span data-time="1402420594" class="timestamp"><p>The road through the bamboo ended at the Ohkohchi-Sanso estate. This estate had been owned by a silent film actor who was famous for his samurai movies. He built the estate as his home and it had long views down the hill and over the city of Kyoto.</p><p>With our 1000 yen ticket ($10) we got tea and a cookie, which we ate in a tea house just after entering the grounds. The path then wound through shrubs and Japanese maples up to the main house. This house is downright modest in size by American movie star standards, but has nice views down and over Kyoto. The path continued wiggling up the hill, through bushes which are probably covered in blossoms in the spring and under maple trees which must be brilliant in the fall. The path passed a shrine which predated the actor's purchase of the property. Then the path went through a small meadow of moss to the tea house. This mossy meadow with its stepping stone path was my favorite part of the grounds. Moss when used as a ground cover is just so delicate, moist, green and lush. There was an additional pavilion at the top of the property with the best views of the city, then we wound back down to the entrance. Just before the entrance we found a newly built memorial building, a "spirit house," to the lady who had maintained the gardens for 35 years. Here were calligraphy pens and paper, and Katrina sat and wrote a note about us having enjoyed the visit.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402424527" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-EAXzgvQIbGM/Vky2WJQY_xI/AAAAAAAAfV0/Li2YIkLHeLY/s288/IMG_4885.JPG" alt="20140610182207, "><span data-time="1402424527" class="timestamp"><p>After Ohkohchi-Sanso we walked north through the leafy and green neighborhoods of Arashiama and Sanso passing a half-dozen or more temples while we looked for Gio-ji. We were hungry at this point and we ended up missing the Gio-ji turnoff, going a few blocks further and stopping at a restaurant for lunch.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402427599" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-HTV_GH5ya78/Vky2WB8gFdI/AAAAAAAAfV0/oE0zab1OeoA/s288/217-P1500218.JPG" alt="20140610191319, "><span data-time="1402427599" class="timestamp"><p>We were the only patrons in the place, and we both ordered a tofu-soup and cold soba noodle menu from the nice elderly hostess. She spoke a few words of English and inquired about our origin, if we were honeymooning, and if we had children. We tried to tell her that I don't eat fish, but my meal still arrived with the fishcake in the soup and a bowl of bonito flakes for seasoning. I just ignored both. The tofu soup was good and made with a super silky tofu which broke apart under any chopstick pressure, so we ate it with our spoons. I particularly liked the soba noodles. There was a dipping soy sauce which the hostess showed me how to season with wasabi and with a small raw quail egg. The hostess also gave us a tourist map after lunch that got us back on track for Gio-ji.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402429578" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-zDD10H2q848/Vky2WJXM-BI/AAAAAAAAfV0/CSR1CnbxdHY/s288/IMG_4891.JPG" alt="20140610194618, "><span data-time="1402429578" class="timestamp"><p>Gio-ji turned out to be the highlight of the day. It is one small moss garden, full of tall Japanese maple trees. Running through the moss is a trickle of a stream. From the roots of the trees grow a few scattered ferns. Off to one side of the garden is a bamboo grove, so when you view the garden from the opposite side the straight and linear bamboo forms a contrasting backdrop to the twisting maples. There are maybe a dozen different mosses being used to fill the garden floor; I could not resist touching them and found them cold and water saturated, as I should have expected.</p><p>We spent nearly one hour circling this little garden and taking in its details.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402436816" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-DamHd1AI2F0/Vky2WDR3osI/AAAAAAAAfas/eRDH68Qu2v0/s288/P1500265.JPG" alt="20140610214656, "><span data-time="1402436816" class="timestamp"><p>Having completed our list of Arashiama sights to see, we decided to follow the advice of the Kyoto Gardens website I have been consulting and visit Daitoku-ji temple complex in northern Kyoto. It was about a 45 minute bus ride with a transfer to get to Daitoku-ji, and along the way it rained. Thankfully the rain had subsided before we disembarked.</p><p>Daitoku-ji is actually a large complex with more than twenty Zen sub-temples which are independently run. The downside to this arrangement is that each sub-temple charges its own admission fee. The gardens website had noted five gardens in the complex; we visited three.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402436919" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-wK0WwW9mATM/Vky2WHWiyGI/AAAAAAAAfas/2XgcAWSDGOc/s288/P1500266.JPG" alt="20140610214839, "><span data-time="1402436919" class="timestamp"><p>Our first visit was to Ryogen-in. This Zen temple has five gardens. The first one we visited was A-un, a narrow garden between the temple and its exterior wall. Signage said this garden is about yin and yang. I was a bit more intrigued by Totekiko, a small rock garden of three rocks in a sea of gravel filling the space of maybe six tatami mats. This garden was described as the smallest Zen rock garden in Japan and is slotted in between the walkways of the temple buildings. The Ryugintei moss garden did not keep my attention at all because Gio-ji was still fresh in my mind. My favorite of at Ryogen-in was the Isshidan rock garden, with its oval island of moss in the linear sea of gravel. We sat and took this garden in for many minutes while it lightly rained.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402439174" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-su1toEdYnH4/Vky2WE6MEKI/AAAAAAAAfag/4UGjg6fEC2k/s288/P1500288.JPG" alt="20140610222614, "><span data-time="1402439174" class="timestamp"><p>Our next sub-temple to visit was Zuiho-in. There are two gardens at this temple. The smaller of the two is the Garden of the Cross, which is named as such because the formation of the stones in the gravel sea form a cross shape. The shape is a bit hard to see, but if you look along the diagonal stripes you will find that the island rock are aligned in a straight line, forming the backbone of the cross. There is a shorter line of stones creating the arms of the cross, and if you turn around and look in the other garden at the base of the cross, you find a stone lantern which has a hidden carving of the Virgin Mary. These elements are in the garden because its patron lord was a Christian.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402439576" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-C4mEF4E8PL8/Vky2WO_tZaI/AAAAAAAAfV0/iwCePvI_AE4/s288/IMG_5001.JPG" alt="20140610223256, "><span data-time="1402439576" class="timestamp"><p>The second garden of Zuiho-in is the Garden of Solitary Sitting, and this was my favorite zen garden of the day. A coastline of mossy shores capped by sharp jagged rock mountains protrude into the sea of gravel. The raking creates rings of rising and falling waves which mirror the shape of the moss shoreline. I found it interesting when these waves meet the solitary rock island in the garden. The island adds its own waves to the sea, but they only extend away from the mossy shore. I like the interactions between the mountains and shore and sea, and also the sharpness and height of the mountains.</p><p>We sat on the temple porch pondering the Garden of Solitary Sitting while the rain fell again, this time in a heavy cloud burst. When the rain subsided, the shape of the raked gravel was easier to see because of the contrast added by the wetness.</p><p>Leaving Zuiho-in we came across a pavilion with free "ordinary green tea, brown in color" and had two little cups. We also ate some of the snacks we had with us.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402442010" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-MI5BnASfVtM/Vky2WENxjuI/AAAAAAAAfaY/dfQV8IlK3gw/s288/P1500312.JPG" alt="20140610231330, "><span data-time="1402442010" class="timestamp"><p>We then continued to our final temple Daisen-In, which is has the premier garden in the complex. Apparently Daisen-in is usually mobbed with tourists, and its popular gardens have been photographed (and commercially sold) so many times that the temple now has strict rules against photography. For this reason I don't have any pictures of this garden.</p><p>At Daisen-In we were given a portfolio which described all of the scenes in the garden and told the story they represent. The gardens are modeled after a Chinese painting describing the Zen philosophy on life, living, and death. The first garden we visited had three islands. The central island had rocky mountains from which flowed a waterfall (of raked gravel). This island is the origin of life. To its left and right were islands in the shape of a turtle (representing the negative depths of life) and a crane (representing the positives of life). There was also a rock said to be Buddha's footprint which had a pool of water in a crevasse on its top and the pool of water (actual water) is purported to never dry out. All of the gravel "waters" from this garden flow into the next garden, the river of life. There is a rock in the shape of a treasure ship in the river which is a soul on its life voyage. In the river are rocks as a turtle and a cow trying to fight the current of life, to stay young and to avoid death. Both of these acts are futile. The waters from the river of life then empty out in to a sea of eternity (I think that is its name!) which is the in-between life. The sea is largely featureless except for two conical "salt piles" representing the obstacles to obtainment of enlightenment. The sea stretched around the temple building and back to the starting garden representing the reincarnation cycle.</p><p>Daisen-In by far had the most interesting story set to it. I do now wonder what stories I missed in the other gardens!</p><p>We bused our way back into central central Kyoto and walked the Teramachi shopping arcade and the Nishiki food arcade looking for a Thai restaurant for dinner. We found rice cakes and puff pastries to hold us over but no Thai food.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402451500" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-LPiZA2IdZk8/Vky2WOt4NcI/AAAAAAAAfaY/pKPMcLUI-XU/s288/IMG_20140610_185140.jpg" alt="20140611015140, "><span data-time="1402451500" class="timestamp"><p>We ended up busing back north on Kawaramachi Dori to the road that runs the bottom of the Imperial Palace Grounds. At that intersection there was a little hole-in-the-wall Thai restaurant. The restaurant was clearly Japanese influenced, and did not have any veggie-only curries. After much stress and negotiation, we eventually ordered a clear noodle salad (hold the chicken, hold the shrimp, hold the squid) and a green curry. We chose to overlook the chicken broth in the curry, which our waiter was kind enough to recognize we might not want.</p><p>We went back to the hotel (after Kat got a rice ball at 7-Eleven), did some research for the rest of the week, wrote journals and went to bed.</p><p id="endOfEntry">&lt;End of Journal&gt;</p></span>

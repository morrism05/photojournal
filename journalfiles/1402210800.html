<h2><a id="Kanazawa">Kanazawa</a></h2><h3><a id="1402210800">06/08/2014</a></h3><p>As with yesterday, we tried to sleep in a little later again today and relax. It was around 8am when we started getting up.</p><p>We thought it would be fun to see the "ninja temple" Myoryuji today, so we went downstairs to ask the front desk to make us a reservation for a tour. The very helpful (if not very fluent in English) lady and the front desk agreed to call on our behalf, but let us know we would need to wait until 9am because the temple office was not yet open. Thus, we had breakfast at the hotel. Today they actually made us wait before we could enter the restaurant to keep the crowds under control and today they were much more on top of stocking the waffles and french toast. We had our typical spread of french toast, waffles, eggs and fruit with yogurt.</p><p>We checked back at the front desk after 9am and completed our reservation. We then retrieved our cameras and headed out for the day.</p><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402247587" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-t1MPXnV6BZA/Vky2wCI-yRI/AAAAAAAAfV8/c3bLweidg0M/s288/IMG_4727.JPG" alt="20140608171307, "><span data-time="1402247587" class="timestamp"><p>We took a bus to the Nishi Chayagai neighborhood. Since we were too early for the 11:30am temple tour, we first walked around the one block long geisha street in this neighborhood. One of the houses is now open to tourists, and a very enthusiastic elderly guide took us upstairs to show us the waiting room and the entertainment room. He told us where and how to sit at the table (man on the right of the lady, man sitting cross legged, woman sitting on her knees) and also posed us at the drums and took pictures of us fake playing. We have noticed that more elderly Japanese speak good English than do young Japanese.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402249581" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-8k46mPqD9I8/Vky2wLmHZBI/AAAAAAAAfcE/30yji4HEh30/s288/P1490982.JPG" alt="20140608174621, "><span data-time="1402249581" class="timestamp"><p>The enthusiastic guide suggested we go down the block to Kutani Pottery Kosen, a local pottery studio that specializes in the Kanazawa style. Apparently pottery from this region is world renowned, and Katrina's grandmother even offered to buy her a piece. We got a short tour of the throwing wheels, saw how each piece had specialized tools and measures to make sure they all come out identical, looked at the pottery after drying, firing, glazing and refiring and also looked at the hybrid wood/electric kilns. When a piece is fired in the kiln it is slowly cooled over a week! Katrina looked for a sake set she liked in the store, but the set she wanted was out of stock. The man would not sell the display model.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402254901" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-bqzChInJbzk/Vky2wLjPYsI/AAAAAAAAfcE/azfNIw2BdEU/s288/P1490989.JPG" alt="20140608191501, "><span data-time="1402254901" class="timestamp"><p>We walked to Myoryuji temple with time to spare for the tour, and waited in the courtyard with 50 other people, mostly Japanese. There were two other ladies from San Francisco with a Japanese guide, and we confirmed with them that we were waiting for the right tour; we were. When the tour started we were handed a booklet with all of the dialog for the tour translated into English. The group of 50 was split between five guides.</p><p>The tour highlighted all of the tricky defenses and traps that had been built into the temple to protect against attack. In the main prayer area, the alms box was build into the floor and could be somehow turned into a pit fall. There was a hidden panel in the floor which could be removed and revealed a staircase below. A set of stairs could be retracted to prevent its use. Another set of stairs looked like it was five steps long but when the floor boards on the bottom floor were removed it exposed more steps leading further down - this was described as a pit-fall style trap. There were a pair of sliding doors which when you opened one door you went outside and when you opened the other door you found a narrow passage into another portion of the house. A few stair cases and doors were designed so that defenders could secretly see what was going on on the other side or even attack through the door/staircase. The temple was also built at a time when only two story buildings where allowed in the city, so there is a secret door hidden in the side wall of a closet which takes you up to the third and fourth floors.</p><p>It was fun touring this crazy and serpentine temple! I kept being careful with where I stepped so I would not fall into a hidden trap!</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402255962" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-CDi-c6szc18/Vky2wJazNAI/AAAAAAAAfcE/TEon_MemfnQ/s288/P1490991.JPG" alt="20140608193242, "><span data-time="1402255962" class="timestamp"><p>After the ninja temple we tried to locate a garden in the nearby neighborhood, but did not find anything interesting. We thus walked across town to the far side of the Kenrokuen Garden to find Mojo Cafe which was said to have a vegetarian lunch. We found the cafe, but the lady behind the desk told us in English that she does not make the lunch any more. She suggested we go to the north side of Kanazawa Castle park to find Los Angeles Cafe (haha) which makes vegan food. We walked to LA Cafe but it was closed (Kat read online that they are vacation in May). We had some very good raisin bread from the adjacent boulangerie and then walked back to the tourist shops near Kenrokuen Garden and found a bowl of soba noodles with radish puree and wasabe at the first shop with an English menu. Thankfully the noodles were good. I complimented the noodles and the hostess complimented my chopstick use. After lunch we walked the half block to the rice cake vendor we visited on Friday and got Kat another rice cake.</p><p>We have been finding it hard to find vegetarian food in Japan. Often, the places listed in our guidebooks are closed or their menus have changed. Especially here in Kanazawa finding an English menu is hit or miss, and often it is the same few dishes which are available to us. We usually find something to eat but the process of hunting it down gets tiresome.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402262021" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-3jioT8y2_NY/Vky2wACLwnI/AAAAAAAAfV8/xtC3-urv0cQ/s288/IMG_4737.JPG" alt="20140608211341, "><span data-time="1402262021" class="timestamp"><p>After lunch we went nearby to Gyokusen-en Garden. We were confused that only its restaurant appeared open, but a taxi driver encouraged us to go inside and ask to the the garden and we were able to buy tickets. Honestly, the garden was not quite up to the $7 admission price, but it did have a very nice pond with blooming iris and azalea bushes. I hope some of my pictures around the pond turn out. There was also an interesting note about a lantern with a carving of the Virgin Mary on its base. At some point it was forbidden to practice Christianity in Japan and secret Christians in the country would put their religious carvings on the bases of lanterns so that the ground foliage would hide the icons from view.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402264185" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-npaJmx1fVW4/Vky2wFalahI/AAAAAAAAfb8/OdsIDLy_vlw/s288/P1500025.JPG" alt="20140608214945, "><span data-time="1402264185" class="timestamp"><p>We walked across the boulevard to Kenrokuen Garden to see the areas of the garden which we missed on Friday. It turns out that we saw most of the paid areas, and that there was just a little section of free area full of plum trees (green plums were on the trees) to visit. We rested and regrouped here.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402267764" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Fyy1VDhl5Gw/Vky2wFVaf6I/AAAAAAAAfV8/vtinjIcND9A/s288/IMG_4747.JPG" alt="20140608224924, "><span data-time="1402267764" class="timestamp"><p>Our next move was to walk to Higashi Chayagai district to see the larger geisha area and to try the local Japanese ice cream. I estimated the walk to be five minutes long; it turned out to be fifteen. Once we arrived we set about trying to find Chayu Cafe which was noted for its "uber-Japanese ice cream." We realized that Chayu might not have English signage and so we resorted to stopping in ice cream stores with appropriate menus and asking the name of the store. Thankfully after two attempts we found Chayu.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402268005" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ZfNh7eGSgL4/Vky2wAfDuDI/AAAAAAAAfb8/DkNuJJdB1uI/s288/P1500027.JPG" alt="20140608225325, "><span data-time="1402268005" class="timestamp"><p>The first ice cream we ordered was a dorayaki ice which is a sandwich of two bamboo charcoal pancakes around a scoop of ice cream. We chose "high quality green tea" as our flavor. The pancakes did not really do it for me but the ice cream was good, not very sweet, very strong in tea flavor, with a dusty hint and much more ice than cream. Maybe there was no cream at all? Katrina then wanted to order red bean and chocolate flavor, and there was only one balled scoop left in the bin. We did not want the pancakes this time, but the serving lady told us the balled was too big for a single-scoop cup and could only be sold in the pancake sandwich. We pleaded with her and offered to pay the price of the sandwich if we could only just get it in a cup. Eventually she relented and sold us the scoop in a cup, at cup prices. The flavor was very good, also very icy, and tasted like frozen hot chocolate to me.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402268758" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-hHnlHxW1zCk/Vky2wJ-4ykI/AAAAAAAAfV8/G4VjtVs7Ceg/s288/183-IMG_4748.JPG" alt="20140608230558, "><span data-time="1402268758" class="timestamp"><p>We continued walking around Higashi Chayagai. We stopped in a gold leaf store. Almost all of the gold leaf in Japan is made in Kanazawa. There was a whole storehouse in the building that had been covered in gold leaf - the work consumed 1.5kg of gold leaf. We also marveled at the little bottles of edible gold leaf for sale.</p><p>We stopped in a few other stores but did not buy anything.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402272950" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-kWFN2xF6Rc8/Vky2wFtDb4I/AAAAAAAAfb4/ncO5auyhV0E/s288/P1500046.JPG" alt="20140609001550, "><span data-time="1402272950" class="timestamp"><p>We took the tourist bus to Kohrinbo with the goal of finding dinner. Not quite hungry on arrival, we turned down into the Tate-machi shopping promenade to see what the hip-young things were buying these days. We stopped and bought a small bottle of local sake. Then we looked in the clothing stores.</p><p>Much to our delight we found many stores with English wording clothing, much of it illogical. There also seems to be a focus on place names (mostly from CA or the USA in general), surfing, college, and catch phrases about happiness, love or destiny. We giggle our way through store after store. Katrina considered buying shirts which said "Thieving Cat", "Enjoy College Life Always", "LA Birth Love You", "Park in the Sea", and "Brunch Bigger and better than ever!! Fortunate to have it". I was tempted by a Hawaiian style shirt with multiple Northern California references including "West Coast, Behind of Redwood Curtain, and Donkey." I ultimately found a shirt that references both Destiny, the flap like a butterfly and dry scalp all on one side. We had to look harder for Katrina (she really wanted "Park in the Sea" but they did not have her size) and eventually found her a shirt in the Kohrinbo Mall store Rodeo Crowns. The shirt says "Los Angeles. The Ice-Cold Hello Soda. Rodeo Crowns. Ingredients for Great Day &amp; All Flavor. Santa Monica the city of L.A". We had a bit of a cultural experience in our shopping as many of the young men manning the shops did know English and at least one knew that the shirts were comical. Additionally, when Katrina purchased the Rodeo Crowns shirt, the sales lady walked us to the door and handed us the bag when we were out of the store. Clothing shopping in Japan is such a hoot!</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402281294" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-EQDa9puAzdA/Vky2wA0DI6I/AAAAAAAAfb0/6lhsZC2tY5Y/s288/P1500056.JPG" alt="20140609023454, "><span data-time="1402281294" class="timestamp"><p>Ready for dinner we started looking for food. In order of preference, we wanted to find a cafe with great salads, a Thai restaurant, or an Indian restaurant. We struck out on #1 and #2 and ended up at #3: Aashirwad Nepali and Indian restaurant. There we had the best food (in my opinion) of Kanazawa. The chickpea salad was refreshing, the okra fabulous and the garlic naan out of this world. (The mixed veggie curry was good too.) If only this restaurant were around the block from home! (We did wonder though if our Nepali waitress had pink eye!)</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402283391" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Tj-BNRzDM4Y/Vky2wF5ppiI/AAAAAAAAfb0/AZvWIh-hJdg/s288/P1500060.JPG" alt="20140609030951, "><span data-time="1402283391" class="timestamp"><p>We walked back to the hotel and readied for bed. I used the hotel onsen again, this time trying the open air pool.</p><p>We seem to be tiring of being on the road. I remember this too from last sabbatical where the last two weeks or so were dulled because we were weary of travel and eating out, and ready to go home. Perhaps next time we should keep the travel to five weeks or at least take some personal time at the end?</p><p id="endOfEntry">&lt;End of Journal&gt;</p></span>

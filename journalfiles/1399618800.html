As the roosters started crowing we all bundled up and went outside to watch the mountains become lighted. Annapurna East was the biggest peak in our view and to its right were Patal Hiun Chuli and Machhapuchchhere (Fish Tail Peak). Tilak had told us that Fish Tail Peak is one of Nepal's two "pretty mountains." The peaks were clear until the sun started hitting them, and then wispy clouds formed off their tops.</p></span><span data-time="1399645597" class="timestamp"><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399645597" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-TauQiqEmjXw/U_bTWPVeRSI/AAAAAAAABqo/nQsRSYobzaE/s288/IMG_3081.JPG" alt="20140509142637, "><p>Breakfast was served to us outside. I had two eggs and porridge and Katrina had eggs and a pancake. Sally had a cup of milk with her breakfast and found it to be very tasty. She asked where the milk was from; Madan said it was "local milk" and pointed to a barn around the corner of the courtyard. Also outside in the guest house courtyard were local spinach greens which had been set in the sun to dry. Their smell filled the air (it was not the most appealing smell to me).</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399648615" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-agG9WP4pJ6A/U_bTWpv1tDI/AAAAAAAABqs/Vevq4plrd9k/s288/IMG_3082.JPG" alt="20140509151655, "><span data-time="1399648615" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399648615" class="timestamp"><p>Katrina's knee had been hurting her yesterday, so we pulled out the trekking poles. Kat took one and I took the other.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399649080" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-D4kINza0EK0/U_dJcLvAfoI/AAAAAAAADYs/WaHIgYisQbU/s288/P1460501.JPG" alt="20140509152440, "><span data-time="1399649080" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399649080" class="timestamp"><p>We left Tadapani around 8 or 8:30am, and the first part of the trail was through magically green rhododendron forest with twisting pink-barked trees and nettles as green ground cover. It was so lush and beautiful! The path rolled up and down in the "Nepali flat" style. This portion must also be amazing when the trees are in bloom. Locals hauling chickens, plywood and corrugated metal panels passed us.</p><p>We learned that the porters here earn their pay based on the amount of kilograms they carry and the distance they take it. The stronger porters can carry 80kg of weight.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399651941" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-UwOb7XIH0c4/U_dJou_xdnI/AAAAAAAADao/3x2qk0WLBKo/s288/P1460523.JPG" alt="20140509161221, "><span data-time="1399651941" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399651941" class="timestamp"><p>We made it to the first tea house, but decided not to have tea as only one hour had passed. From here the trail descended into a steep stream gorge via a series of staircases. This portion was also magically beautiful with small cascading waterfalls on our left and the steep twisting staircase in front of us.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399654382" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-yvcdadNs_X0/U_dJynA_HAI/AAAAAAAADcI/5Dc_6b5R07g/s288/P1460540.JPG" alt="20140509165302, "><span data-time="1399654382" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399654382" class="timestamp"><p>Eventually we left the gorge and the trail followed the contours of the land. The density of the forest thinned out. Little wild strawberries and flowers were here and there. We passed a woman in traditional dress collecting young fiddle-head ferns for use in cooking.</p><p>Our guides have been greeting the locals with whom we interact with familiar terms like older sister and younger brother. This is true for everyone they interact with, regardless of if they have met before or not.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399657490" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Fxbm-VGY1Xk/U_dJ5PiiN0I/AAAAAAAADdQ/-uFU8uTvDgM/s288/P1460551.JPG" alt="20140509174450, "><span data-time="1399657490" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399657490" class="timestamp"><p>As we approached our next tea house more and more signs of settlement came visible. The mountainside across the ravine was cultivated in many terraces, and it looked like the mountain side on which we were walking was probably foraged for wood.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399657546" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-RptBpyJ8UxI/U_dJ5iVMRZI/AAAAAAAADdk/CLZmhdjNRjM/s288/P1460552.JPG" alt="20140509174546, "><span data-time="1399657546" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399657546" class="timestamp"><p>We made it to the tea house and split a masala tea. This tea house had a beautiful flower garden of marigolds and roses. We had descended far enough that the air was hot and humid again.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399660135" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-cMddOdv8W_o/U_dJ75Z_o3I/AAAAAAAADd8/8L1PME1JijI/s288/P1460555.JPG" alt="20140509182855, "><span data-time="1399660135" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399660135" class="timestamp"><p>It was maybe ten minutes to the beginning of Ghandruk. Ghandruk must be as large as all of the other villages we have seen on this hike all combined. While all of the other villages have had at most 10 guesthouses, there are more than 50 here ( I estimate) and they seem to be building more by the minute.</p><p>We walked for ten minutes just in Ghandruk alone, taking wide staircases past guesthouses, farms and stores. We also passed a construction site were - just like in Tadapani - men were hand chiseling blocks of stone into regular brick-like shapes.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399661808" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-2JOds4UdMvA/U_dKCOkbAtI/AAAAAAAADew/MnHNhf9U_Ww/s288/P1460569.JPG" alt="20140509185648, "><span data-time="1399661808" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399661808" class="timestamp"><p>We made it to Hotel Sakura just before lunch. This hotel is the most substantial and best gardened guest house of our trek. It has western toilets and clean hot showers.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399664548" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-CGX8uEpvjBI/U_dKERzE45I/AAAAAAAADfQ/YLDdqB4mfXk/s288/P1460572.JPG" alt="20140509194228, "><span data-time="1399664548" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399664548" class="timestamp"><p>We ordered lunch. In the 30 minutes we were waiting John came in and talked with us. He and Marilyn had come to Ghandruk yesterday via hours and hours of stairs. The stairs had been too much for Marilyn and she had a relapse of her traveler's diarrhea. The doctor had been to see her today; they were not sure how they would get her back down the hill tomorrow.</p><p>Our lunch was a "bean burrito" which turned out to be a reasonable approximation of the Mexican dish of the same name and "veggie enchiladas" which turned out to be home made pasta with veggies and mushrooms. The burrito was enjoyed more. I also ordered an apple strudel from the kitchen/German bakery and was suitably impressed with the beauty of the pastry. The taste wasn't so bad either.</p><p>While talking at lunch we learned from Trevor that our hotel in Gorepani had actually had a western toilet! Katrina and I thought it rather humorous that we had been so desirous of a western toilet but never opened the door of the second bathroom to discover its existence.</p><p>We showered in the (relatively) luxurious shower and I did some clothes washing at the outside tap. I tried to wash my clothes Nepali style using bar soap and scrubbing them with a hard brush.</p><p>At 3:30pm Tilak told us that Marylin was getting worse and that they would need to bring here down the mountain so she could get to Pokhara to go to the hospital. Tilak, our strong porter, and Madan went down the mountain with Marylin on the back of one of the guides.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399676784" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-TMRmAk6wM4A/U_dKG0wOdkI/AAAAAAAADg0/MKrCUVksP1E/s288/P1460576.JPG" alt="20140509230624, "><span data-time="1399676784" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399676784" class="timestamp"><p>Almost immediately after Mingma and a local guide Raj (who found many things incredibly funny, including Katrina's name) took us on a tour around Ghandruk. We first went to a local museum which showed the many tools, baskets and kitchen wear from traditional local households. I was not clear how long ago these items would have been used. Impressive to me were the many different types and uses for baskets. Some were for carrying different types of goods, some for penning in animals large and small, some for food. We also saw the many brass bowls, pots and pans used in the household.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399677469" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-pKS4XPvATuc/U_bWJJ0th3I/AAAAAAAAB00/QY6-b0tDTo0/s288/IMG_3174.JPG" alt="20140509231749, "><span data-time="1399677469" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399677469" class="timestamp"><p>We exited the museum and took a small back-streets tour of Ghandruk. This village has a population of 10,000 people. We went by people drying soy beans in their yards, a lumber yard where they were making boards with hand tools, a place where men were forming the strips of bamboo which are used in basket making. We then came out through some of the garden plots used by the locals. Some local kids ran by on the way to the school's basketball court.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399678437" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-UiYmtPZG0YA/U_bWX6lMGjI/AAAAAAAAB1s/AWn3VNSG1R8/s288/IMG_3181.JPG" alt="20140509233357, "><span data-time="1399678437" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399678437" class="timestamp"><p>The final stop of our tour was the helipad which looks over the valley. The far side of the valley is all terraced agriculture, and appears to be serviced by a dirt road.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399679116" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-bHBMUySHp5Q/U_dKSeHx-II/AAAAAAAADhw/OG1-kuPo1ec/s288/P1460594.JPG" alt="20140509234516, "><span data-time="1399679116" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399679116" class="timestamp"><p>We returned to the hotel and ordered our dinner. Tilak and the strong porter returned at 6pm from their trip down the hill with Marylin.</p><p>For dinner we had tried to order the curry portion of daal bhat, however we had a hard time explaining to Mingma that we just wanted the that portion and not to order the veggie curry which is on every menu but is a veggie soup. What we ended up with as the veggie soup, without any broth. Oh well. (We tried ordering the daal baht without the daal and baht but we got the soup without the soup!) We also had corn bread and onion rings.</p><p>During dinner Trevor made us associate members of Xian Red Wine Club, of which he is El Presidente. We shared an Australian Shiraz with him.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399688859" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ULf-hzwCJkQ/U_dKUtQz3AI/AAAAAAAADjE/zG9Yv2g5eGw/s288/P1460599.JPG" alt="20140510022739, "><span data-time="1399688859" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399688859" class="timestamp"><p>After dinner Tilak took our tips for the junior guides (the "boys") and the porters. He took all of our cash, then in front of us and the staff he split the cash into equal piles, told us all how much was in each was in each pile, and then handed us money to give to each specific guide/porter. I gave the share of the tips to our strong porter, whose name I still don't know! :(</p><p>We then retired to our rooms to get some sleep before our (hopefully) sunrise wake-up call to see the Annapurna mountains one last time.</p><p id="endOfEntry">&lt;End of Journal&gt;</p></span></span>

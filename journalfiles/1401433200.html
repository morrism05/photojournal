<h2><a id="Osaka">Osaka</a></h2><h3><a id="1401433200">05/30/2014</a></h3><p>We boarded our flight to Osaka at about 12:20 am this morning. We had window and aisle seats at the bulkhead for economy class. As it turned out, the plane was only half full. Katrina and I tried to sleep as much as possible on the five hour flight. I think I managed to sleep four hours or so. We were fed a breakfast of cream and veggie filled crepes, a salad and fruit. We are both looking forward to eating more fresh vegetables in Japan.</p><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401463878" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-POZt6AeQ91Q/Vibx9BOT-EI/AAAAAAAAanE/QkECaQguHNI/s288/P1480626.JPG" alt="20140530153118, "><span data-time="1401463878" class="timestamp"><p>The skies were hazy when we landed in Osaka. We cleared immigration, got our packs, and got lightly questioned and searched by customs. Now fully in Japan we looked for the train station so we could transfer to Osaka's Namba station. It turned out that only cash could be used on the Namba line, so we had to find an ATM back in the airport (we used 7-Eleven ATM as we believe it does not have a usage fee) where we withdrew the rough equivalent of $300. 1 yen is worth about 1 US cent.</p><p>The train ride took about 45 minutes (we did not pay for the express) and it made nine stops along the way. The train filled with commuters going into the city. The woman next to me was working on some English studies. I was worried about discomforting her with my tropical sweaty scent.</p><p>It was fun to watch the houses and apartment blocks go by out the windows. The little farms in the lots between houses are present here, just as they were in our last visit to Japan. Fresh rice starts are visible. Japanese housing is more functional than pretty - boxy bland buildings with minimal decoration and no yards. The architecture in Osaka was largely the same.</p><p>When we disembarked from the train in Namba, we followed the signage to exits on the north end of the station. Along the way we passed a bakery, and decided to grab a bite. Kat's croissant was "eh", and the corn topped pastry I purchased turned out to have ham in it. Strike 1.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401468631" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-WmI59nnaizA/Vibx9OAfQlI/AAAAAAAAanE/v2Vii9v5Y5c/s288/IMG_4151.JPG" alt="20140530165031, "><span data-time="1401468631" class="timestamp"><p>Making use of maps that were in the station we found our way to the Cross Hotel with very little trouble. The Cross Hotel is on Midosuji boulevard, which is a massive street. It is also very close to the Dotonbori River and all of the shopping arcades there. We were unable to check in until 2 pm, so we dropped off our bags with reception and went to breakfast at Taste Table, the in-building restaurant.</p><p>Taste's specialties are sweet things it says, and it had pretty pictures of pancakes on the menu. We ordered cream cheese stuffed pancakes with eggs and salad. Kat used Google Translator to tell the waitress that we don't eat fish or meat, and it seems to have worked as we did not get the side of ham. The pancakes turned out to be fabulous. Also impressive was the fake maple syrup. The maple flavor was so well emulated that Katrina even put a second helping on her pancakes. I have never seen her do that with syrup before.</p><p>We decided to take the subway to the Osaka Castle Park to while away some hours before check-in. The Osaka Castle was rebuilt many times in its history due to war and fire, and the current concrete-core structure is not all that old. As such our plan was to enjoy the outside views and the park.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401472633" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-19uPDLmnbso/Vibx9LVBoLI/AAAAAAAAanA/HOkrIUDXLK0/s288/P1480632.JPG" alt="20140530175713, "><span data-time="1401472633" class="timestamp"><p>The subway ride was fun. We enter the subway via a department store and a short detour to checkout their basement food level. It turned out the be a confectionery floor. Once in the subway system all the little jingles we remember from trains and subways in Japan are still alive and kicking. There is a jingle that plays when the train is arriving, and another when the train is about to depart. Another Japanese phenomenon was seeing a middle aged man reading a magna magazine with a cover that looked like it was for a soft-core porn on the train.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401474302" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-mOkq8QDw0-4/Vibx9K4GoMI/AAAAAAAAanE/S5P6RMhbiMk/s288/P1480635.JPG" alt="20140530182502, "><span data-time="1401474302" class="timestamp"><p>We walked all around the Osaka Castle and its park. Most interesting were the two concentric moats, with the tallest and thickest fortification walls I have ever seen. The walls use natural stone as their material, and some stone blocks are the size of a detached garage. It is astonishing to think of men moving these stones from 100km away to be put into place. Also interesting were the couples doing wedding photos in the park. We only saw two couples, but both were in full traditional Japanese dress.</p><p>We checked out the gardens and views of the castle from all sides. When we were leaving the castle park a group of middle school kids came around a corner and one young man decided to exercise his English.</p><p>Boy: "Are you from America?"<br>Me: "Yes."<br>Boy: "I play baseball! I don't have a dog."<br>Me, laughing a little: "I don't either."<br>Boy: "You are nice."</p><p>The conversation was so out of the blue and so quick that it completely tickled us. We were left laughing out loud.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401482226" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-YSdjk_q8sZQ/Vibx9De2BlI/AAAAAAAAanE/i6lsFkShHJs/s288/P1480670.JPG" alt="20140530203706, "><span data-time="1401482226" class="timestamp"><p>We returned to the Cross Hotel by subway and checked into our room. It is much more modern and comfortable that I was expecting. I don't think I realized we had booked a $120 room! The bathroom is full on modern Japanese, with an automated toilet/bidet/air-drier and a shower and tub room where there is a glass door to seal the room and the whole floor drains clean of water, so you could shower anywhere you wanted in the room and it would be fine. There is also a little stool in the room just like in the onsen that you can sit on as you shower. Katrina and I both tried to shower onsen style as a test run for our upcoming onsen experiences.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401491133" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-EEkBSAIiBhI/Vibx9CMhbJI/AAAAAAAAamw/XyPFz_TPKtw/s288/IMG_4164.JPG" alt="20140530230533, "><span data-time="1401491133" class="timestamp"><p>After the usual internet use and washing of clothes, we headed out in to Dotonbori to find lunch at Imaihonten. This TripAdvisor recommended establishment is in the heart of the Dotonbori shopping street. We were brought to the 4th floor seating area (most of the buildings here have stores going six floors or more up, and you have to use the elevator to get to the store you want) were we ordered bowls of udon soup and soba soup (identical except for the noodle type). I think I like the soba soup a bit more. The soup also had two large tofu pieces which had been marinated in a sweet marinade which made them taste like the tofu wrappers around inari sushi.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401494667" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Jbl6N_jqEPU/Vibx9Ok725I/AAAAAAAAanE/B5SFF1m-mGI/s288/P1480692.JPG" alt="20140531000427, "><span data-time="1401494667" class="timestamp"><p>After lunch we wandered around the Dotonbori neighborhoods, looking at all the different restaurants, window shopping the souvenir and clothing stores, buying some sunscreen at a pharmacy, noting how many 18 and older night-clubs there are (it seems like 20% of the businesses fit into this category).</p><p>Many restaurants around here offer blowfish for eating. We saw a small truck with delivering the fish. Its rear was all tanks full of water, and there were even some windows in the tanks through which we could see a few fish.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401495153" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-xoymKEw_keM/Vibx9LCMVLI/AAAAAAAAamw/u_V57wL6j-M/s288/IMG_4166.JPG" alt="20140531001233, "><span data-time="1401495153" class="timestamp"><p>We walked down a little stone ally between several of the major pedestrian walks and found a small shrine. We had heard about this shrine in our reading. The ritual here is to splash water onto the shrine's statues. As a result, the statues are now covered in thick green moss. Both people who looked like local businessmen and women as well as Asian tourists were splashing the shrine.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401495910" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-TY1hFcyATxg/Vibx9LTlq1I/AAAAAAAAanE/qgZKOgE6Xd4/s288/P1480706.JPG" alt="20140531002510, "><span data-time="1401495910" class="timestamp"><p>We walked on the west side of Midosuji Blvd and found it to be a little less trafficked, but still full of stores and restaurants. The crowd on this side tended younger and looked more likely to be shopping for counter-culture clothing than to be shopping the high-end brands and department stores of the other half of Dotonbori. We sat and people watched for a little while.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401499071" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-1W-UHOQNyV0/Vibx9Adk-1I/AAAAAAAAanE/rplRJ90JXb8/s288/P1480711.JPG" alt="20140531011751, "><span data-time="1401499071" class="timestamp"><p>To keep Katrina awake, we kept walking looping back to the west side of Dotonbori. We started looking for dinner, hoping to find an okonomiyaki restaurant. The okonomiyaki restaurant recommended by the guide was closed, so we checked menus at other locations before settling on one with an English menu and proud advertising about its tomato covered okonomiyaki. We were happy to find that there were Japanese patrons in the restaurant and that we were not responsible for cooking the okonomiyaki ourselves on the hotplate embedded in our table. (We did the cook it yourself style in Tokyo four years ago.) We ordered the tomato, cheese and mochi okonomiyaki, and the pancake/lateka like cake arrived with an egg topping and a brown sweet sauce. The waitress then poured the rest of the toppings and sauce over the cake. We actually really enjoyed the meal, and the chunks of fresh tomato were delightful too.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401502504" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--MFiQ-JuCnA/Vibx9Pcxv0I/AAAAAAAAanA/JD6wMebpII0/s288/IMG_4173.JPG" alt="20140531021504, "><span data-time="1401502504" class="timestamp"><p>Now that the sun was mostly set we spent a short time looking at Dotonbori with its lights on. Stepped into a UFO arcade (UFO is the Japanese term for the claw machines) to see what strange things could be grabbed. The machine with the squeezy balls with perky nipples got my vote for the strangest. Katrina thought the baseball-sized breasts were a little small.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401503345" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-6Dj_QZ9ts68/Vibx9HhOxbI/AAAAAAAAanE/vIdeALlyZCE/s288/P1480726.JPG" alt="20140531022905, "><span data-time="1401503345" class="timestamp"><p>Went back to the room and planned and packed for our Komano Kodo hike. We will aim to get on the 9:22am train from Tennoji to Kii-Tanabe tomorrow morning.</p><p id="endOfEntry">&lt;End of Journal&gt;</p></span>

The sun was rising but it had not yet hit the face of the mountain. We opened our windows and took in the view for the next 30 minutes or hour as the sun slowly lit the (few) east facing slopes of the mountain. Not long after Annapurna East was fully lit the sun started hitting the lower flanks of the mountain near us and exposed the smoke in the air from the cooking fires.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399470550" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_eLgc4GzA4I/U_dGHZNsyaI/AAAAAAAAC00/8CHcRR2clQk/s288/P1460129.JPG" alt="20140507134910, "><span data-time="1399470550" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399470550" class="timestamp"><p>We all gathered at an outside table to take our breakfast. Katrina's "rosty with egg and cheese" dish was the best of today's selections. By the time we had finished our meal Annapurna East was clouded over.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399475332" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-h_zmPuzSSV0/U_dGIyiMevI/AAAAAAAAC1E/_aaLJi-1fvg/s288/P1460134.JPG" alt="20140507150852, "><span data-time="1399475332" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399475332" class="timestamp"><p>Leaving Ulleri we continued climbing steps through the terraced farms. We passed a few school children who were literally running down the steps to get to school way past Ulleri in Turkadunga, the town with the waterfalls.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399478278" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-xw_5YrYbzeA/U_dGK251UbI/AAAAAAAAC1w/FCnbBIzWzwk/s288/P1460140.JPG" alt="20140507155758, "><span data-time="1399478278" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399478278" class="timestamp"><p>About one hour into our trek we stopped for tea at a tea house and we all shared a large thermos of masala tea, which is basically like the chai tea we know in the USA.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399481669" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-wd9A7YXwU2I/U_dGPKGN_OI/AAAAAAAAC24/DBnM4D9heVk/s288/P1460149.JPG" alt="20140507165429, "><span data-time="1399481669" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399481669" class="timestamp"><p>From here on out, the trail wound through rhododendron forest along the edge of a rushing creek. The number of farms and villages greatly decreased. The views into the creek and its many waterfalls were very nice. The winding up (and a little bit down) of the trail through the trees was also very scenic and we tried to get several staircase photos of the trail.</p><p>Today I was trying a different approach to where I hiked. While yesterday I was hiking at the front to take pictures of what was coming, today I hiked at the back and took pictures in the reverse direction. Sometimes I would also let the group go ahead so I could take pictures in the forward direction with a clear view.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399486654" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-8qqPEtFC95o/U_bNg7gTWtI/AAAAAAAABI0/tbEF-qey_UA/s288/IMG_2807.JPG" alt="20140507181734, "><span data-time="1399486654" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399486654" class="timestamp"><p>At one point in the trail we came directly along the creek, and I was able to take pictures of the waterfalls.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399487471" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-IxBL6uFDQlM/U_bN1Yw_8rI/AAAAAAAABKU/-tzDnQKSfV8/s288/IMG_2819.JPG" alt="20140507183111, "><span data-time="1399487471" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399487471" class="timestamp"><p>Our other fun find along the trail were pitcher plants.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399488686" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-hpaMH6pYOEE/U_dGiRIxSkI/AAAAAAAAC6w/EEH6w9m4P-0/s288/P1460188.JPG" alt="20140507185126, "><span data-time="1399488686" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399488686" class="timestamp"><p>We took lunch at the Green View Restaurant. I ordered the rosty with egg and cheese (same as Kat had at breakfast), but it turned out this restaurant did not do quite as good a job with its rosty. Kat ordered fried vegetables which turned out to be mustard greens. She was a bit concerned as to if they had been adequately cleaned and cooked, but with both ate them. This was the first greens we have had in Nepal!</p><p>During lunch the junior guide Madan came in to talk with us and practice his English. He is taking a number of courses at the university including some on tourism and how Nepal can grow and improve its tourism. The goal in his mind seemed to be about how Nepal could support more tourists. I wondered about how more tourists could be supported without causing Nepal to lose its authenticity. (Frankly though, how can I tell if the Nepal I see today is like the Nepal of the past? Judging by the number of guest houses in each village on our hike, I would say it has already been changed.)</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399496193" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-scmGreLf2to/U_dGlSQL7AI/AAAAAAAAC7k/J7He4e_Faj8/s288/P1460196.JPG" alt="20140507205633, "><span data-time="1399496193" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399496193" class="timestamp"><p>It was 1.5 hours and about 400m of elevation to get to Gorepani from our lunch stop. We climbed through more rhododendron forest to get there. Gorepani itself is not as pretty as the other farming villages we have passed so far. The guest houses here are all much larger, and much plainer with basic blue sheet metal exteriors. The town also seems to be covered in small roach-like flying insects. A few hotels here have WiFi.</p></span><span data-time="1399500513" class="timestamp"><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399500223" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-rC1gH4ojxqc/U_dGq7hzARI/AAAAAAAAC8c/k1mNTZSUO60/s288/P1460207.JPG" alt="20140507220343, "><p>There was a chance we would do a Poon Hill summit on this day of the hike, but since the skies are all clouded over we hear it is not worth the effort. Instead, we are going to relax at the guest house and just do tomorrow morning's early summit. Our hotel room is very basic - Katrina notes that the construction is roughly equivalent to interior of a moving pod. I took a wood-powered hot shower - someone in the GH staff lights a fire to heat my water. The shower room was a dark and dingy, almost dungeon-like room in the basement level of the hotel. Since the electricity was not on in the village I was given an electric lantern to light the room.</p><p>I have to say that other than today's Annapurna East sighting, I think I liked yesterday's hike better. Today's hike would be great in rhododendron season though!</p><p>It rained all throughout most of the evening, but there were a few breaks where Annapurna's tall snow-capped peaks came into view. I hung some wash around the stove in the center of the dinning room. We played hearts with Sally and Judy, and at about 7 pm dinner arrived. We shared momo, veggie curry and rice pudding. The electricity finally came on before bed.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399515361" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-VrqH5zdH-Eo/U_bObIwh_mI/AAAAAAAABOk/oMVoGb0iVuI/s288/IMG_2856.JPG" alt="20140508021601, "><span data-time="1399515361" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399515361" class="timestamp"><p id="endOfEntry">&lt;End of Journal&gt;</p></span></span>

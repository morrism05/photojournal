<h2><a id="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a></h2><h3><a id="1399014000">05/02/2014</a></h3><p>Some impressions about the Hong Kong people. The people here have mannerisms and dress style which is more in-line with American expectations than matching the high-couture styles of Tokyo or Moscow. Katrina was expecting to see lots of high-heels and designer clothing, but we have not seen it so far. The way people laugh, smile and interact with each other here seems pretty familiar.</p><p>I too find that my preconceived notion of how Hong Kongese would appear differs from reality. I was expecting manor and dress like that of the wealthy mainland Chinese who come visit America. However I am not seeing the bejeweled t-shirts and jeans of that crowd.</p><p>Another trait of Hong Kong I have noticed is an obsession (?) with health and germs. We have encountered elevator buttons and escalator hand rails with signage guaranteeing that regular disinfection occurs to them. There are also many public service ads and signage reminding about good health practices to avoid spread of flu.</p><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399033334" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-lyVui-_ItF4/ViGp8xYI6mI/AAAAAAAAMys/N-OsbJD8BPA/s288/P1450485.JPG" alt="20140502122214, "><span data-time="1399033334" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399033334" class="timestamp"><p>About our day. We woke up early at about 4:30am after what felt like a very good night's sleep. The bed is too short for me, but otherwise comfortable. We hung out and watched the sunrise from our room's windows, then dressed for the day and went down to breakfast in the hotel's Thai restaurant.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399038147" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ih3MwMxZUD8/ViGp8yqpxLI/AAAAAAAAMys/J7G50kVXR9o/s288/P1450496.JPG" alt="20140502134227, "><span data-time="1399038147" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399038147" class="timestamp"><p>Being 6:30am, we were the only patrons in the restaurant. The breakfast buffet had both Eastern and Western breakfast. Chow mien noodles really do work fine next to yogurt and cereal. I was happy that plain unsweetened yogurt was available for us, as it is my usual morning food, and I told Katrina she should have some after her oatmeal. She went and filled herself a bowl with yogurt, raisins and corn flakes, came back to the table and took a big spoonful. Her expression turned for the worst and she looked around wildly for a napkin into which she could spit out the mouthful. Bleh! She had filled her bowl with mayo instead of yogurt!</p></span><span data-time="1399041227" class="timestamp"><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399040865" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-OtxVrbPlRSY/VjeYVeSgtlI/AAAAAAAAekI/UfundCw2GcE/s288/IMG_20140502_072745.jpg" alt="20140502142745, "><p>We walked to Mongkok metro station and via some streets full of construction supply stores. Many more people are out today - including many school children. We took the metro to Admiralty stop and "alighted." Admiralty is situated in the middle of all the banking skyscrapers. We wound our way through the towers and around the multi-lane thoroughfares to the Peak Tram.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399043855" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-z0NMFB8U32U/ViGp83g83kI/AAAAAAAAMys/QWMFPUXZFjk/s288/IMG_2310.JPG" alt="20140502151735, "><span data-time="1399043855" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399043855" class="timestamp"><p>There was hardly any wait to board the Peak Tram, which takes you up about 90% of the way to the top of Victoria Peak. The railway is one of the binary tram systems where one tram acts as a counterweight for the other. The tram tracks get very steep (maybe 30% grade?) at some points in the journey making the towering apartment blocks appear to tilt severely with respect to the tram windows. At the top of the Peak Tram is a horrendously touristy mall, which we did our best to escape from, and nearby is the Lugard Road trail which follows the mountain slope and looks down upon Hong Kong and Kowloon. We walked Lugard Rd the 2.5KM to its end, and were absolutely enamored with the beautiful jungle forest, the tangled old Indian Rubber Trees (which Katrina recognized from plantings her grandfather had), and most of all with the spectacular views of central HK and its skyscrapers. Unfortunately on our way out there was still lots of cloud and haze over HK, so our views (and photos) were partially obscured. Things had cleared a bit on our return walk giving us improved photos.</p><p>When we got back to the Peak Tram we found it was crowded with tourists. As I was checking out a city overlook at a pagoda, we watched as a group of Chinese tourists talked an American man into posing with them for pictures. Katrina and I laughed as we remembered Chinese in Dali asking to take photos with us. We hurried off so that we would not be re-subjected to the experience.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399052759" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_H4Yy9BndOA/ViGp8wW1VYI/AAAAAAAAMyo/f3b2uuOs038/s288/IMG_2366.JPG" alt="20140502174559, "><span data-time="1399052759" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399052759" class="timestamp"><p>We took the tram back down to central Hong Kong and were surprised to see that the tram station now had an massive winding queue of tourists waiting to summit the peak. Thankful that we had arisen early, we left the hoards behind and went looking for an early (11am) lunch at Pure Veggie House. This vegetarian restaurant is on the third floor of a tower that is adjacent to the HK zoo. It took a friendly stranger to help us locate the right elevator for the restaurant. The restaurant though was a joy! Easily my favorite restaurant of the trip, I was impressed by their black truffle dumplings, pan fried vegetable dumplings, mapo tofu, and dun-dun noodle soup. Wonderfully, the mapo tofu was so tinglingly hot with spice and chili that the hot sensation turned to cold in my mouth as if I had just sucked on a mint! We also tried congee, but were not as wowed with this dish, which basically is watery rice.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399060613" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-vwFqTZkSK5A/ViGp8_0cI3I/AAAAAAAAMys/bW7rYbXbGg0/s288/P1450581.JPG" alt="20140502195653, "><span data-time="1399060613" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399060613" class="timestamp"><p>After lunch we walked in the zoo (entrance is free) and came face to face with red crested cranes then spent many minutes watching the gibbons swinging about in their cages. Real gymnasts these gibbons!</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399061885" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-sKSPkUG3ZWU/ViGp8_6QHjI/AAAAAAAAMys/KsOhSqTR5is/s288/P1450585.JPG" alt="20140502201805, "><span data-time="1399061885" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399061885" class="timestamp"><p>We exited the zoo via its west end and walked along Caine Rd going west through the mid-levels of HK. In the stacks of apartment towers are all schools, groceries, restaurants, hospitals, etc that support city life. Except that everything is built on a hillside and goes straight up in to the sky, it mid-level feels like a normal urban neighborhood.</p><p>We wound our way west and down to Sheung Wan neighborhood, and doubled back on Queens Road West to return to Central. The road here is lined with dried good stores which sell predominantly seafood or Chinese medicines. Again, the wares in the stores look familiar from American Chinatowns, but I would not have the slightest idea what to do with them.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399070630" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-S1Su7hTgprI/ViGp8wI_F6I/AAAAAAAAMys/nwIRzfRlReI/s288/P1450587.JPG" alt="20140502224350, "><span data-time="1399070630" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399070630" class="timestamp"><p>Tired and a little overheated, we returned by metro to the Dorsett Hotel, checked our their lounge (free water and snacks!), then cleaned up in the room.</p><p>At about 6pm we left the hotel again to see the famous shopping streets of Mongkok. Mongkok is the densest residential neighborhood in the world with 330k people in 1 square mile, yet up until this evening we had hardly seen a crowd on the streets. That all changed when we made it to the shopping district near Mongkok MTR station. People were pouring out of the station and the sidewalks were swarming with shoppers and commuters.</p><p>Katrina and I have not been to a mainland China big city (other than the touristy bits of Beijing), but my impression of Mongkok is that it is similar to such a Chinese city. Everything is crowded here, and some businesses pour out onto the streets. We passed a few auto repair shops, for example, which had no garage but instead did all of the repairs in the street. At least in the sections we passed, the stores do not give much effort to beautiful displays or orderly appearance. Everything is jammed together however it fits inside the store confines. Older buildings here look like they have not received paint jobs or external repair in quite some time, and have a dirty weathered patina to them. Yet, on the other side of the street might be a 40 story class walled office building or condo tower.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399079362" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-8MjEK2SsJ2Q/ViGp85c9e4I/AAAAAAAAMys/WDdJQ9h-VA8/s288/P1450589.JPG" alt="20140503010922, "><span data-time="1399079362" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399079362" class="timestamp"><p>On our Mongkok tour we first walked along the Flower Market which was two square blocks of florest, garden, and plant stores. We peaked at the bird market (it was pretty quiet), and then walked south on Sai Yee, Fu Yuen and Tung Choi streets to see what was being sold there. Sai Yee had several pedestrian-only blocks of market stalls selling clothing, and Tung Choi St is "goldfish street" and had many shops full of fish in plastic bags and aquarium equipment. Katrina thought she wanted a new camera bag, so we fought our way through the crowds to Shan Tung St to the camera and electronics district, but by the time we got there Katrina did not have the appetite to shop in the stores considering all of the crowds.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399082978" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-f9_YcP4cP48/ViGp844lb8I/AAAAAAAAMyo/-lHHOTF-3aQ/s288/P1450607.JPG" alt="20140503020938, "><span data-time="1399082978" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399082978" class="timestamp"><p>We decided instead to walk Nathan St south all of the way to Tsim Sha Tsui so we could see the night skyline. The crowds were oppressive at first, but as we left Mongkok and neared TST the shopping and buildings went more upscale the number of people went down (and the sidewalks broadened) making travel easier. I wanted to get to the waterside so I could take clear pictures of Admiralty and Central, but as we approached we found the bayside railings absolutely mobbed with people. Almost exactly as we arrived spotlights and laser lights turned on and music started playing; the buildings across the bay were being lighted in tune to the music in a Symphony of Lights. It was a fun surprise for us and we enjoyed the animation.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399087524" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-GIl_XoiAnHw/ViGp80FCWiI/AAAAAAAAMys/nv0K-iva5eg/s288/IMG_2399.JPG" alt="20140503032524, "><span data-time="1399087524" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399087524" class="timestamp"><p>The show ended in about 20 minutes and we milled around a little taking more skyline photos. Finally, we walked back north to Tsim Sha Tsui metro and rode back to Mongkok station. We got an avocado and cheese sandwich on the way home (as dinner), then with sore feet and tired bodies got ready for bed.</p><p id="endOfEntry">&lt;End of Journal&gt;</p></span></span>

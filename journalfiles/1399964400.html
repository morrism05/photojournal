Tilak was in the lobby seeing off Trevor, Judy and Sally to Chitwan. We waved them goodbye and then Tilak arranged for us to get driven to the airport at 10:30 by yesterday's van driver.</p><p>We over-ate at breakfast hoping to be able to skip lunch. The buffet was yummy as always; I really like their banana bread.</p><p>We sat in the lobby for a while, loading reading materials onto our phones for the upcoming journey. I loaded more F80 M3 reviews. We also received word that our old landlords have found renters for our apartment, but that the new renters will start after our last month's rent is complete so we will not get any rent back. Oh well.</p><p>Katrina has learned that there are protests currently occurring in Bangkok. We hope this will not inconvenience us, beyond some added traffic.</p><p>We packed our bags and caught our ride to the airport. It is pretty warm out today, and as crazy as ever on the streets. I am pretty surprised that we have not seen any traffic accidents, though yesterday the van driver did bump another car!</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400006839" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Bn5AAw6Av2w/VjeZktBvlOI/AAAAAAAAemc/-RrufX125qE/s288/IMG_20140513_114719.jpg" alt="20140513184719, "><span data-time="1400006839" class="timestamp"><p>Check-in to Thai Airways flight 320 was slow but painless. We took a few minutes to convert what little Nepali rupees we had left into Thai Baht. 30 Bhat is approximately $1. Here in Nepal security lines are split for males and females, because each person gets an intimate pat-down. When it was time for us to go through security there was a line of 40 young men in the men's line and no one in the women's line. This inequality in gender headcount continued in the waiting area of the terminal. Large groups of 20-something men (often wearing a matching piece of clothing like a hat or t-shirt) dominated the crowd. I did not get an exact sense of what these groups are, but they seemed as if they could be groups of young people leaving the country for employment.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400011497" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-JejPSCm1ynQ/VjeZktKzrpI/AAAAAAAAemg/I9FHkHxlWhQ/s288/IMG_20140513_130457.jpg" alt="20140513200457, "><span data-time="1400011497" class="timestamp"><p>We eventually boarded our Thai Airways 777-200 aircraft via the tarmac and mobile steps. The plane is so large when viewed from the ground! We were sitting in the third-to-last row of the plane because at the very back of the plane there are only 2 seats in the outside rows instead of 3. I had the window and Katrina took the isle. The knee room was generous, which I appreciated.</p><p>As we departed it became that the group of young men around us had never been on a plane before. They did not know how to buckle their seatbelts, did not know how to operate the tilt on their chairs, and were super interested in looking out the window at the scenery below.</p><p>The second time I went to the bathroom I had to wait behind a few of these men for the use of the toilet. I watched as the men entered the bathroom but did not lock the door. (The signage was in Thai and English; I assume they only spoke and read Nepali.) Then, they struggled to get out of the bathroom again afterward as the folding door which needs to be pulled inwards was foreign to them. I finally got my turn at the toilet, made sure to lock the door and flush the toilet (the last few had clearly not known how to flush). When I finished, unlocked the door and pulled it open, 4 guys where staring and me and the bathroom with big beaming smiles on their faces! Perhaps this was the first time they saw how the process worked?</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400026229" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-khSIapiAIgk/Vib4SoiWkXI/AAAAAAAAa1c/50bRAF3V4g8/s288/P1460771.JPG" alt="20140514001029, "><span data-time="1400026229" class="timestamp"><p>We had our cheesy veggie meals on the plane, watched movies (I watched most of The Wolf of Wall Street) and looked our the window. As we approached Thailand I was impressed and excited by how clean and pollution free the air was (the air over India had been dreadful) and how beautiful the green hills and lakes were. The hills flattened as we descended and farm country started to dominate. Very narrow rectangular farms with their small edges along canals are the norm near Bangkok. The skies were also cloudy over Bangkok and one cloud was releasing the biggest torrent of rain I have ever seen on a localized area.</p><p>We landed and were walloped by the heat and humidity as we transited the gap between the plane and jet bridge. It was 91F at the moment, and this was cool for the day!</p><p>Bangkok airport is a staggeringly large and somewhat coldly modern facility. We learned that it had been SE Asia's largest airport until a few years ago when Singapore expanded its airport. Regardless, it was quite a contrast to the three gate international terminal in Kathmandu with its brick one-story construction and tarmac boarding process.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400031477" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ZRo5x5V-K24/Vib4Snm11rI/AAAAAAAAa1c/QnbZbgPKSpY/s288/P1460781.JPG" alt="20140514013757, "><span data-time="1400031477" class="timestamp"><p>Customs and Immigration were quick and easy. Outside of the security zone we met our Bangkok guide for the coming few days. His English nick-name is Dom and he is a Bangkok native. Dom talked to us a bit about the history of Bangkok as our van took us via very modern highway infrastructure to downtown and the Tai-Pan hotel. Looking out the window and the scattered skyscrapers, modern vehicles and signage and perfect highways I was happy to be back in the civilized world after the chaos of Kathmandu.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400033738" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-0lzbfAiT6B0/Vib4St6y6PI/AAAAAAAAa1c/2J8up0ZEQLc/s288/P1460783.JPG" alt="20140514021538, "><span data-time="1400033738" class="timestamp"><p>We checked into the Tai-Pan with Dom's help but had to switch from the initial king-bed room to a twin room so that we could have a non-smoking room. The room is comfortable through not super luxurious.</p><p>We then ventured out onto the streets to find an ATM and dinner. It was hot and muggy outside, but manageable seeing as it is night. (Sunset was around 7pm.) We passed a few street grates that smelled of raw sewage, and a number of women with children begging for money. Otherwise the city seems nice. There are many skyscrapers in our neighborhood and we are located near the skytrain metro.</p><p>Katrina was busy counting how many older white men she could spot with younger Thai women. She counted more than six couples of this composition.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400037538" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n860Q8BD3v0/Vib4Sth34DI/AAAAAAAAa1c/sZBj-ET_VsE/s288/P1460785.JPG" alt="20140514031858, "><span data-time="1400037538" class="timestamp"><p>The ATM came courtesy of Citi Bank (with a 180 Bhat fee). For dinner we followed the recommendation of Dom and went to Cabbage and Condoms - a Thai restaurant where the proceeds are used to fund a project to bring condom usage to Thai tribes in rural areas. The point of the project is to lower STD rates. We ordered pad woon sen and a green curry. Both were good, though the curry was the better of the two. The total cost was about $12 for the meal.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400040363" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-W1jigdH0ftQ/Vib4Sh3r6JI/AAAAAAAAa1c/PWr6jCg4PWA/s288/P1460789.JPG" alt="20140514040603, "><span data-time="1400040363" class="timestamp"><p>Afterwards we crossed Sukhumvit Rd to check out the Terminal 21 mall. This mall is shiny new, and each of its floors has a different theme. The top floors are Hollywood, Pier 21 (referring to Pier 39), and San Francisco. I enjoyed the model of the Golden Gate Bridge, which had model cars on it's span. Paris, Caribbean, Rome, Istanbul, and London were also represented.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400042388" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ITBqufXW-70/Vib4Skx51rI/AAAAAAAAa1c/f8HkGPJoQ4M/s288/P1460797.JPG" alt="20140514043948, "><span data-time="1400042388" class="timestamp"><p>We returned to the hotel and got ready for bed.</p><p id="endOfEntry">&lt;End of Journal&gt;</p></span>

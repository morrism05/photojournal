We donned the heavy red jackets from Peregrine tours and our head lamps and headed out the door. The sky was just showing the faintest hint of lightening as we started out 400m climb up the many steps to Poon Hill (3210m). I had woken up with a headache and the bright lights were jarring to me as we climbed.</p><p>After about 15 minutes I had worked up enough heat to remove the jacket. We passed through a ticket gate where we bought 50 rupee tickets to the top. The sky was now light enough that we could make out the outlines of the Annapurna peaks of Annapurna South and Annapurna 1. About half way up the hill Katrina lost patience with slow pace set by the guides and we broke away for the top. I had a backpack while she did not and she outpaced me up the hill! I was certainly huffing and puffing as we climbed.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399551208" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Zpb_4joww9s/U_dG2ZlrlGI/AAAAAAAAC_A/TQri_FRc_QA/s288/P1460230.JPG" alt="20140508121328, "><span data-time="1399551208" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399551208" class="timestamp"><p>We summited in the early morning light before the mountain peaks shone brightly with any sunrise rays. Poon Hill summit was crowded 100 or so tourists, and people were staking out corners of the hill or of the viewing tower where they could see all the mountains on the NE facing horizon without obstruction. As the sunlight finally hit the mountains the sky was mostly clear. We stayed up on Poon Hill for maybe 45 minutes watching the different peaks become more and more lighted and then watching them disappear between the gathering clouds.</p></span><span data-time="1399556314" class="timestamp"><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399554381" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Fy4D3e62mSo/U_dHPGNXQAI/AAAAAAAADEU/G_zFkBkaDXQ/s288/P1460270.JPG" alt="20140508130621, "><p>Once the clouds had covered most of the view we descended back to our hotel in Gorepani. Breakfast was waiting - I had corn bread (which was very yummy at this stop) and eggs. Kat had the same. We packed up our gear - I made an effort to lighten my pack as much as possible - and then around 8:15am we started our day's trek.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399563450" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-cLVSX0_UKzs/U_bPtZ8L8VI/AAAAAAAABYE/OA3K2MN4XB8/s288/IMG_2931.JPG" alt="20140508153730, "><span data-time="1399563450" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399563450" class="timestamp"><p>Our first challenge was to summit Gurung Hill, which was nearly equivalent to reclimbing the elevation of Poon Hill. During this climb I spent a lot of time looking back at the snow covered peaks. At the top of the hill we took a little rest break and then dipped and wiggled along the hill top. I got very excited because the rhododendron forest we were walking through had flowers! The trees were not covered head-to-toe in flowers, but rather a tree would have a few bunches of pink flowers. Still, looking at all the flowers on the south side of the hill was amazing.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399569473" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-lYEqw4elD3A/U_bSN4Gp65I/AAAAAAAABh8/EVipebViBsQ/s288/IMG_2973.JPG" alt="20140508171753, "><span data-time="1399569473" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399569473" class="timestamp"><p>We started a descent into Deurali where we had some yummy gingery masala tea. From Deurali we had a long two-hour trek down a gorge. At the higher elevations we saw many more rhododendron trees. The cliffs towered on both sides of us and the stream running the canyon cascaded in many small waterfalls. The trail was super steep, and we did not see anyone hiking up in the opposite direction.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399577144" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-KGkg21gpZHw/U_dImRb4TqI/AAAAAAAADO4/eJUo80ubwWA/s288/P1460403.JPG" alt="20140508192544, "><span data-time="1399577144" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399577144" class="timestamp"><p>We hiked five minutes past the village of Banthanti and took lunch. Tilak had sent word ahead that we were coming for lunch, so the kitchen was ready for our orders. I had pizza, and it turned out to be excellent (though not so much like actual pizza). We watched Tilak doing push-ups in the courtyard as he waited for his lunch - this trek must not be challenging enough for him! There was a little toddler in the courtyard too, and she started yelling and pointing at something way up on the hillside. She had spotted a mountain goat!</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399582060" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-3hF3etHUEgk/U_dIsSeg92I/AAAAAAAADQE/wgN0Pu73678/s288/P1460415.JPG" alt="20140508204740, "><span data-time="1399582060" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399582060" class="timestamp"><p>After lunch we had 15 minutes or so of traversing the hillside (departing from the course of the stream) before we came to a viewpoint out of the mountains to the south. It turned out we were looking at Ulleri way off in the distance!</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399584303" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Mh_RWi-qHvM/U_dIvxn9W9I/AAAAAAAADQ0/dUB_RHsoC6w/s288/P1460427.JPG" alt="20140508212503, "><span data-time="1399584303" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399584303" class="timestamp"><p>The trail the became super steep going down. On this portion Katrina's knee started hurting so I did what I could to take weight off her pack, including taking her camera gear. As the descent came to its end at a stream, we spotted a troop of four or five monkeys dining in the trees.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399585303" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-BE3Rli4K2Cs/U_dIzjr2F_I/AAAAAAAADRk/2rWsjaHnhYU/s288/P1460435.JPG" alt="20140508214143, "><span data-time="1399585303" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399585303" class="timestamp"><p>We slogged back up an equally steep climb of twisting staircases. When the grade finally lessened we were at the edge of Tadapani in a beautiful forest of twisted rhododendron trees and small green ground cover of nettles and other clover sized plants.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399587127" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-hfS0EuntOpY/U_dI2qK-WSI/AAAAAAAADkg/VG7lxX6W0cE/s288/P1460439.JPG" alt="20140508221207, "><span data-time="1399587127" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399587127" class="timestamp"><p>We arrived at our guest house, Hotel Panorama Point, and checked-in to our rooms. The rooms here are super plain, but at least they were painted (yesterday the wall board was unpainted).  The wall boards are also largely superficial barriers between the guests rooms; when Katrina applied the Tiger Balm that Trevor had lent her to her hurt knee, and Judy and Sally in the next room over reported smelling the balm in their room too!</p><p></p>Katrina was giddy to learn that there is a European toilet here! This was the first time we have had a non-squat toilet at the hotel.<p></p><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399596632" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ekNRu_yCeK0/VjeZI_WKQpI/AAAAAAAAemQ/D-YZznhzQMQ/s288/IMG_20140508_175032.jpg" alt="20140509005032, "><p>Katrina and I waited in line for some Hong Kongese women to complete their showers, and emerged from our hot shower colder than ever because we were wet! We bundled up and retreated to the elevated dining hall which has a fireplace. We played hearts again with Judy and Sally, and while I played one of the hotel staff (maybe a son of the family?) looked over my shoulder and offered advice. It rained super hard and even hailed, and then quickly cleared and gave views onto the mountains.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399601077" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XTsTV5cmpMQ/U_dI5hz65WI/AAAAAAAADSg/itToh0Y3ASM/s288/P1460443.JPG" alt="20140509020437, "><span data-time="1399601077" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399601077" class="timestamp"><p>Our dinner came at 7pm. Katrina and I both had corn bread and veggie soup. The dining room was super toasty and warm with the fire, and it seemed as if all the hotel guests had come to the hall all at once.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399601511" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-JpNkW6kLoeA/U_dI6MumteI/AAAAAAAADSs/7t9J62m1mG0/s288/P1460444.JPG" alt="20140509021151, "><span data-time="1399601511" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399601511" class="timestamp"><p>We went to bed around 8pm, calling out goodnight to each of our trekmates through the paper thin walls.</p><p id="endOfEntry">&lt;End of Journal&gt;</p></span></span>

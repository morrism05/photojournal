We did venture back down to the hotel restaurant for the breakfast buffet, but Katrina noticed that the buffet had less vegetarian options today than it did yesterday, so we decided to eat elsewhere. After searching around the neighborhood, we settled on some baked goods from a bakery. The bread was airy but not all that interesting.</p></span><span data-time="1399134353" class="timestamp"><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399132119" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-t8vITq_dAmE/VjeYVcTwrrI/AAAAAAAAekI/C78SGdQOWaA/s288/IMG_20140503_084839.jpg" alt="20140503154839, "><p>We decided to checkout, leave our packs at the front desk, and go to the Ngong Ping 360 cable car which leads to the big brass Buddha on the top of Lantau island. We were worried there might be a long line to board the cable car, but at 9am there was no wait at all. The 20 minute cable car flies over a bay, then across the mountain peaks to the monastery. There is an impressive hiking path (all stairs and wooden decked platforms) that traces the same route - a few hardy souls were doing the route on foot.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399136123" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-6ckorGTquDQ/ViGp8x0JdfI/AAAAAAAAMys/yj286VzLo9I/s288/P1450648.JPG" alt="20140503165523, "><span data-time="1399136123" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399136123" class="timestamp"><p>At the end of the cable car ride we walked through the tourist village and then climbed the steps to the brass Buddha. The Buddha was about the same size as the Nara Buddha we saw four years ago, which is to say it is really big! As impressive as anything is the backdrop for the Buddha - the green mountains with green waters below, islands on the horizon. From here (and from the cable car) we could see off to what I believe is Macau, and probably off to some of China too.</p><p>We tried to visit the monastery temple too, but there was some official event occurring with many uniformed boy scout students and a marching band. Thus, we got to the exterior of the monastery but did not venture inside. Anyway, it appears that this monastery is still under construction (in fact you can donate money for construction materials if you like).</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399139528" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-DYasLXsaICA/ViGp8_bD2YI/AAAAAAAAMys/iOG9lTifVMw/s288/P1450669.JPG" alt="20140503175208, "><span data-time="1399139528" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399139528" class="timestamp"><p>We returned via the cable car (the line to buy tickets had grown to a massive length) and then took the metro all the way back to central Hong Kong. Our goal was to return to the Pure Veggie House from yesterday. We did find the restaurant again and this time we ordered hot and sour soup, eggplant, crispy noodles with mushrooms, BBQ bun, herb pouches, and what we expected to be soup dumplings but where actually veggie dumplings. Everything was very good again - though I think that yesterday's dun dun noodles and mapo tofu might still be my highlight from the restaurant.</p><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399150135" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-vhhsfY1PR3A/VjeYVeAZvlI/AAAAAAAAekM/xDeJ4mgJA5Q/s288/IMG_20140503_134855.jpg" alt="20140503204855, "><p>We walked back to the metro past the Peak Tram tracks, via Hong Kong park and then mistakenly through a serpentine mall near Admiral Station. We get the feeling that central HK may have as many malls as does Las Vegas! We rode the metro to Mongkok station, and found the neighborhood as overwhelmingly busy on Saturday afternoon as it is on Friday night. We thought we were fighting our way to Mongkok street, but we turned out to be going the opposite direction. This put us right by the camera store mall that Kat was trying to find yesterday, so we went inside and got her a new camera bag to replace her old one with the broken zipper.</p><p>We fought our way out of Mongkok and retrieved out bags from the Dorsett hotel. I really enjoy my stay here and would stay again.</p></span><span data-time="1399160021" class="timestamp"><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399157665" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-bOpjvtFsJqk/VjeYVVbBYgI/AAAAAAAAekI/FnefkiS4YEc/s288/IMG_20140503_155425.jpg" alt="20140503225425, "><p>We journeyed to the airport and had our first taste of Nepal while waiting to check in. The check in line disorderly snaked this way and that across the airport, the customers were traveling with large families and worn luggage, and there were not enough employees processing the check ins. eventually the informal portion of the line approached the formal tape gates, and it was then that a Nepal airlines employee pulled all of the white people out of line and sent is to a special check in desk! We got through very quickly but felt like we had cheated.</p><p>As Katrina and I sat in the Hong Kong airport waiting for our flight to Katmandu Nepal, I emailed my family. We have very much enjoyed our visit to Hong Kong. The city and landscape is so beautiful - we expected everything to be a skyscraper and the architecture to be wowing, but we did not also anticipate such tall, green, compelling mountains too. Both times we went into the forested peaks we were awed by the natural beauty of the rich forest and vertical landscape.</p><p>When exploring the city, depending on which neighborhood we were in we either felt like we were in a modern western city, or it feels like you are in a modern Chinese/Asian city. In some parts of Mongkok - the neighborhood where our hotel was situated - Chinese signage is everywhere, the buildings are architecturally anonymous concrete towers with grimy patina, and the tiny shops along the sidewalks are packed to the brim and sometimes their business spills out on to the sidewalks and streets. This is what I would imagine modern developing China to be like, though honestly I don't have much experience in China. Central HK by contrast contains glassy iconic skyscrapers, many shiny clean marble-floored malls and plenty of hip eateries to satiate your hunger.</p><p>Speaking of hunger, I was very happy as a vegetarian in HK. We ate four of our six major meals at vegetarian restaurants, and found lots of tasty dishes to enjoy. One thing that surprised me a little was that the food I ordered was generally not that spicy. I guess well have to wait until Thailand before I question my ability to handle the heat of my meals!</p><p>One observation about the Hong Kongese is that no one wears clothing with Chinese writing. All annotated t-shirts were in English with sensical grammar.</p><p>Our Nepal Airlines flight was a continuation of our cultural experience. The plane was a threadbare 757 with a cabin that looked to be original, by which I mean it looked 20 years old and ready for a refresh. Half of the flight attendants were dressed in saris and there was an interesting older attendant as matron to younger attendants dynamic going on. Seating assignments seemed no guarantee of securing a particular seat - though our seats were respected - and I was surprised to see people walking the isles after the plane was moving.</p><p>I tried to sleep on the 4h30m flight. I just had my eyes open during the dinner service which was a beans and vegetables with rice dish. Our row mate was a 50 or 60 year old Nepali man, who requested to finish all of the portions of Katrina's meal she had not tried.</p><p>Our landing was a bit of an experience itself. We came in through the clouds, and when we broke through there clouds there were very few lights below us to be seen. I presumed we were directly over Kathmandu, Nepal's largest city, so this was a bit unnerving. Eventually, I was able to make out that each building in the city had one or two bare light bulbs its exterior (except for hotels, which were completely lit-up) and that there were no street lights at all on the ground. When we flew into Hanoi 4 years ago the experience was similar - completely blacked out landscape below as we came back to earth. The act of landing itself was uneventful, though our row mate did burst out clapping when the wheels touched the ground. (The only other flight I have been on where people clapped when the landing occurred was in Brazil.)</p><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399188988" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-44X8Bwpyxhs/Vjewek2kmgI/AAAAAAAAeu4/-qJPVg9YTcc/s288/IMG_20140504_003628.jpg" alt="20140504073628, "><p>Once the plane stopped all of the Nepalis sprang to their feet and rushed to grab their bags and disembark. When we did deplane, the air outside smelled slightly sweet; I don't know what the smell was but it was pleasant. Could it be from wood fires? We got our visas (no line - yay!), waited for our bags to arrive (Katrina's bag had all the zippers open as if it had been searched), and then met our Peregrine tours driver outside of the airport.</p><p>The drive to the Shangri-la Hotel was an interesting one. Again, there are no street lights to it is only the headlights of the cars to light the road. Also missing from the streets are stop lights and stop signs. Late at night this did not seem like to big of a deal. The roads are in bad repair and are very dusty, potholed and bumpy. Packs of stray dogs trot across the pavement or idle long the roadside. Just like as it was in Hong Kong, Nepal is a British style drive-on-the-left country.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399194685" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-a1IO-IQzUGY/U_bFsQWzFuI/AAAAAAAAAe0/3ubLA6QJOhw/s288/IMG_2447.JPG" alt="20140504091125, "><span data-time="1399194685" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399194685" class="timestamp"><p>Shangri-la hotel is a massive gated compound. The gates and walls make it look like this should be a $300/night establishment; the actual hotel and rooms seem more like a $65/night place. Our room will do just fine though.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399194774" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-olOeiwdwEP0/U_dDP7-FLhI/AAAAAAAACRk/OHYZBGvoxS8/s288/P1450702.JPG" alt="20140504091254, "><span data-time="1399194774" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399194774" class="timestamp"><p id="endOfEntry">&lt;End of Journal&gt;</p></span></span>

The snow from yesterday was mostly cleared from the streets - it looks as if 3 inches fell here. (My internet research revealed that the snow storm was focused on northern France and Germany, and that Frankfurt airport was completely closed by the storm.)</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363198637" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-52BnihaEsMY/VhgiAodlM6I/AAAAAAAAITI/SjCRFZ2L2po/s288/P1410083.JPG" alt="20130313181717, "><span data-time="1363198637" class="timestamp"><p>Our first stop was as the Paul Sender bakery, one of Megan's favorites. We picked out two types of chocolate croissant - mine was a rectangular one and Katrina's had the ram's horns shape. Katrina's turned out to have chocolate creme in the center, which was very yummy.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363199121" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XBguvrAkgwU/VhgiCR9m3GI/AAAAAAAAITY/EnEjSTHzy3E/s288/P1410086.JPG" alt="20130313182521, "><span data-time="1363199121" class="timestamp"><p>We headed for the Rose Garden by the Dom first, as I wanted to take pictures of Bamberg in the snow. However, the gates to the Rose Garden were closed. We finished our pastries and then continued on to the Michelsberg monastery.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363200416" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-M2FioosMwtY/VhgiK6gOsBI/AAAAAAAAIUk/agLIZHf7htE/s288/P1410097.JPG" alt="20130313184656, "><span data-time="1363200416" class="timestamp"><p>The monastery is on an adjacent hill to the Dom and Neue Residenz, and it also overlooks the city. The church here was also closed, so we just walked around the inner courtyard and then out to the back gardens that look down on the city. The view is quite panoramic and very pretty. Unfortunately, the thick snow we were walking through in the garden were freezing Katrina's feet and making her rather uncomfortable.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363202479" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-29hvB2fekxE/VhgicwH6pGI/AAAAAAAAIXE/JGwtWLtMDQk/s288/P1410123.JPG" alt="20130313192119, "><span data-time="1363202479" class="timestamp"><p>We headed down from the hill, past the Rathaus and into the new city. Along the way Katrina spotted a poppy seed pastry for which Bamberg is known, and we bought for later. We found the Turkish restaurant Efendi which Megan and Ethan had told us about, but it turns out they only serve dinner. Thus, we turned back towards the river and ate at the kebab house which was by the spaggheteria.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363206055" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-I7B1jmUhCdU/VhgimdLH6mI/AAAAAAAAIYY/dls0vA69QO0/s288/P1410134.JPG" alt="20130313202055, "><span data-time="1363206055" class="timestamp"><p>The kebab restaurateur did not speak much English, but through pointing we were able to make our order. Both of our falafel dishes were yummy, and the shop keeper noticed us thawing our hands and thoughtfully gave us cups of hot tea as warming devices.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363207790" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-2--UH6ZKKLs/VhgipM0nnBI/AAAAAAAAIYw/IAdnCLGoNo8/s288/P1410136.JPG" alt="20130313204950, "><span data-time="1363207790" class="timestamp"><p>After lunch we went to the tourist information center to inquire about beer tours. It turns out you need a large party (say 10 people) to organize a tour, so there was nothing for us to see. We browsed the guide books and were taken by pictures of the Neue Residenz, so we decided to visit it.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363209040" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-p7RRGmoPaIk/VhgirOEtu1I/AAAAAAAAIZA/Su2VVzR0XF4/s288/P1410139.JPG" alt="20130313211040, "><span data-time="1363209040" class="timestamp"><p>The Neue Residenz is another palace of the Prince Bishops of Germany. Here we were led on a tour through three wings of rooms for receptions, meetings, living spaces and banquets. Like in Wurzburg sculpted stucco and bright, punch frescos decorated the rooms. My favorite room was the grand room with the portraits of the princes on all the walls. The ceiling fresco was jumping with colors and activity, and was really captivating and exciting.</p><p>After our tour, we walked back to Megan and Ethan's and found Megan taking a practice MCAT test. I checked my email and discovered that my Nurburgring track day for the coming Sunday has been canceled on account of the snow. This is quite a disappointment! We also investigated the weather for the next few days and found it is expected to snow a little more in the Alps on Thursday and Friday. We are going to see if we can get our car swapped for one with snow tires.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363226204" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-j-pPeZFQJog/ViFjQfp8KrI/AAAAAAAAKOQ/ql1DjHk418A/s288/IMG_20130313_135644.jpg" alt="20130314015644, "><span data-time="1363226204" class="timestamp"><p>We started a laundry load and then headed back down to Bamberg for dinner at Scheiners Gaststuben. We ordered a very German kasespatzle (which basically tastes like macaroni and cheese) and a mushroom dumpling for dinner. I also ordered apfelstrudel for desert. The entrees were tasty, if super heavy. The mushroom dumpling brought back strong memories of my trip to Austria in 1999, when the only vegetarian food we could find was mushroom bread dumplings. Thankfully I have not needed to eat this meal multiple nights in a row!</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363228484" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--x_-FyjS5I0/ViFjQeXSD-I/AAAAAAAAKOQ/FFPkS9NKr_U/s288/IMG_20130313_143444.jpg" alt="20130314023444, "><span data-time="1363228484" class="timestamp"><p>We walked back to the house, watched the announcement of the new pope, and then readied ourselves for bed.</p><p id="endOfEntry">&lt;End of Journal&gt;</p></span>

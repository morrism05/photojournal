<h2><a id="Ankgor Wat">Ankgor Wat</a></h2><h3><a id="1401001200">05/25/2014</a></h3><p>This morning we woke at 5 am to go see the sunrise at Ankgor Wat. When we went to reception a little before 5:30 am to collect our boxed breakfasts, the driver was already waiting. We followed him to the car and headed off for the temple, eating our cut mango, banana, and pineapple as well as two croissants. We picked up Set on the way.</p><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401021523" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-J1u6SpOVYjg/VkoaOVe9hqI/AAAAAAAAfNg/RaNZ5_t2Wdw/s288/P1480156.JPG" alt="20140525123843, "><span data-time="1401021523" class="timestamp"><p>The sky was already light though the sun was still below the horizon when alighted from the car at Ankgor Wat. We watched from the moat around the temple for a few minutes; the sky was largely clouded over and there were was not much in the way of sunrise colors. Many other tourists were watching from the moat to, most with breakfast boxes from their hotels in hand.</p><p>Ankgor Wat is built on a symmetrical and nearly square plan. The outermost layer is the moat, then the temple gates and walls which enclose a large expanse of yard. In the center of this yard in the mighty temple itself, it took rectangular, symmetrical, and layered. Its outside layer is a covered hallway/gallery, where long carved wall murals tell the stories of Hindu myths or of battles fought by the king. The gallery rectangle leads via staircases to an interior of pools (unfilled while were were there) and what now are Buddhist prayer halls. From another rectangular open air courtyard is accessed, and the long and steep staircase up to the five stupas which define Angkor Wat's silhouette can be accessed.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401021873" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-5NozSIqM8k0/VkoaOQfg32I/AAAAAAAAfNc/vCNFj8mo7U8/s288/P1480162.JPG" alt="20140525124433, "><span data-time="1401021873" class="timestamp"><p>From the moat area, we proceeded into the major courtyard and watched the sun crest the horizon from two vantage points. The first vantage point put the sunrise and the few sunrise colors behind the temple's towers. The second vantage point had us standing in front of a muddy pool trying to get a reflection of the towers in the water. The water surface was not still, so this did not work well. While we were here, Set went off to get himself some noodles for breakfast, and was gone for 25 minutes. We were left twiddling our thumbs and shooing away the restaurant stall hawkers during this period.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401024967" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-h5VQhAaUy2I/VkoaOWCc7lI/AAAAAAAAfNU/YSL7wIkyE9Y/s288/P1480182.JPG" alt="20140525133607, "><span data-time="1401024967" class="timestamp"><p>When Set returned, we continued to the outer gallery with the carved murals. These murals were some of the more interesting things from our day and they are highly detailed and show hundreds of figures, usually army soldiers, commanders, and deities, marching, fighting, and working. The murals cover about 60% of the outer gallery wall space, but were never completed as the king died before the temple construction was finished.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401025329" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-hhbFl6qs1tE/VkoaOdEHlyI/AAAAAAAAfNQ/ZRA_u5DNVqo/s288/P1480195.JPG" alt="20140525134209, "><span data-time="1401025329" class="timestamp"><p>We then went into the next interior layer to look at the hallways and (currently dry) pools on the reception level. This area had less of interest for me.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401026002" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-onLGsS1m6CA/VkoaOdkhd8I/AAAAAAAAfNM/p_TQ_0kFzMI/s288/P1480204.JPG" alt="20140525135322, "><span data-time="1401026002" class="timestamp"><p>We returned down to the gallery level to see a few more murals, including the mural where the gods have taken their magical snake the "naga", wrapped it around a mountain, and are tugging on opposite sides of the snake to spin the mountain and churn the oceans. Their goal is to dry up the ocean of milk so that the liquid of immortality is left behind. In the process, then end up inadvertently creating apsara - beautiful female dancers who now dance the national dance of Cambodia.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401028844" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-PwDPvz7mHPI/VkoaOSEn2TI/AAAAAAAAfNA/36n6yqsqu6A/s288/P1480247.JPG" alt="20140525144044, "><span data-time="1401028844" class="timestamp"><p>By the time we had visited the last mural, the staircase to the 5 central towers was open to visitors. We climbed this extremely steep stair and arrived at the bases of the five stupas. We admired their adorned faces.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401032734" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-WZrK8elOXPs/VkoaOZbzmwI/AAAAAAAAfM4/U8CYbqGpBCk/s288/P1480277.JPG" alt="20140525154534, "><span data-time="1401032734" class="timestamp"><p>From Angkor Wat we drove to Angkor Tom. Angkor Tom is an even larger moated and walled area which is 9 km squared in size and used to enclose a city of 100,000 people. Right now there is no remnants of that wood-construction city, but the stone temples inside remain. We stopped at the moat and moat and wall gate first. The bridge to the gate had statues of the gods and demons pulling the naga to churn the oceans. On the top of the gate, we saw our first examples of the big smiling faces which look in four directions.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401034136" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Z63u8UWc8qk/VkoaOSi2nPI/AAAAAAAAfM0/Jtxav7dPAKg/s288/P1480293.JPG" alt="20140525160856, "><span data-time="1401034136" class="timestamp"><p>These big smiling faces are the central motif at Prasat Bayon the next temple we visited. This temple (actually all of Angkor Tom) was created after Angkor Wat. The king who built this temple moved the center of his kingdom to Tom to avoid the seasonal floods in the Angkor Wat area. Set says that Bayon was build many years after Angkor Wat, and that the skilled labor for building and stone working was gone by that time. Thus, the temple recycled the foundations of a prior temple and also used stones scavenged from other sites to build its towers and walls.</p><p>This temple was built as a Buddhist temple, and on each tower there are four faces of Buddha looking in the four cardinal directions. There used to be more Buddhist imagery on the temple too, but a later Hindu king destroyed it all. He only preserved the smiling Buddha faces because he said they were the faces of Brahma.</p><p>Just like at Angkor Wat, Bayon also has stone carved wall murals to view. Some of the scenes were of everyday life, including some of child birth and others of construction techniques used on the temple.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401036613" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Naxjlt2Yjh8/VkoaOZPzJgI/AAAAAAAAfMs/EpBgwThYyRk/s288/P1480315.JPG" alt="20140525165013, "><span data-time="1401036613" class="timestamp"><p>We were able to climb up to a secondary level in Bayan, where we could stare the Buddha faces right in the chin. These faces are a bit puzzle-piece like, as they transitions between the blocks of stone which make the full face are not perfectly smooth, and the seams can be seen This level was quite fun to explore and photograph.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401038812" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-4lckI9OU-GM/VkoaOVBgn3I/AAAAAAAAfMo/zZ7Mikjv2ls/s288/P1480337.JPG" alt="20140525172652, "><span data-time="1401038812" class="timestamp"><p>We walked to the adjacent Baphuon temple. This temple has a long elevated bridge leading to its face. It is a partially reconstructed temple in that only the bridge-facing side is complete. The reconstruction of the other sides was interrupted by war in Cambodia, and the notes about which blocks were found where in the excavation were lost. The other sides have been attempted to be recreated, but they are not confident in the results. At Baphuon there was an opportunity to climb to the top and overlook the jungle. I did the climb but Katrina did not, as she had cramps. When I descended the far side of the temple I saw that the far wall was arranged in the shape of a reclining Buddha. This arrangement had been done by Buddhists years after the temple was built.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401040774" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-WJuXTWmlKKU/VkoaOTLcmUI/AAAAAAAAfMk/LV771mMTlfk/s288/P1480350.JPG" alt="20140525175934, "><span data-time="1401040774" class="timestamp"><p>Walked back to our driver via the grounds of the Angkor Tom royal palace. There is not much left of the palace grounds, other than another smaller temple and several large pools. We existed by the elephant pavilion.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401042035" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-20dw9HUpAkw/VkoaObWdWfI/AAAAAAAAfMg/yKVrqCJXP1E/s288/P1480353.JPG" alt="20140525182035, "><span data-time="1401042035" class="timestamp"><p>We were driven to Prasat Ta Prum, which is one of the most recent temples to be reconstructed. The work has been going on for the last eight years and is being done by the Indian government. Actually, many of the reconstruction efforts are being done by archaeologists from other countries. (One temple was being reconstructed by Cambodians when it was struck with lightning. The Cambodians took this as a bad omen and abandoned the reconstruction. The work has only recently been restarted by Chinese.)</p><p>The signature style of the Ta Prum temple is that soon after its construction it was abandoned and overgrown with trees. Today there are roots from 500 year old trees winding down the walls and through the stonework. This gives the site a very exotic lost in time feel, which is probably why some of the Tomb Raider move was filmed here. (Angelina Jolie is a favorite celebrity of Siem Reap now, and we were often told of places she where had eaten or said.) The popularity of this temple with tourists and its tighter, warren-like confines meant that our views were often obstructed by other visitors. Set guided us around the crowds whenever possible; we mainly learned that the King built this temple for his mother. On our "free time" we found a few more awesome trees draping the stonework.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401047683" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-bS2ulpkuqDA/VkoaOXOf4tI/AAAAAAAAfLc/F_t72mVBZmM/s288/P1480408.JPG" alt="20140525195443, "><span data-time="1401047683" class="timestamp"><p>This was the last stop of our tour, and Set dropped us off in Old Town. We went for lunch at Khmer Kitchen #2, where we had Khmer Kitchen soup (tasted like it had chicken and even through the staff assured us there was only mushroom we did not finish it), mango salad, and pumpkin and coconut curry which was neither spicy hot nor richly coconut-y. Then went to The Blue Pumpkin, a highly advertised ice cream parlor, for ice cream. We tried the ginger and sesame flavor and also the four spices flavor. They were pretty good!</p><p>Back at Golden Banana II Resort, we swam at the hotel pool and tried to float on the inflatable reindeer. I was successful in this regard. We considered whether or not to cancel our Ko Samui visit. Thailand has not really gotten worse, though a few protesters were defying the rules against gathering and marching. More concerning was that some small weapons caches had been found in the hands of Red Shirts supporters in the northern provinces. Ko Samui itself seems out of the fray, as all the news is about Bangkok and the northern provinces where the Red Shirts come from. Thus we decided to go to Ko Samui after all.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401062025" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-pxHmsKqJfJg/VkoaOSscr1I/AAAAAAAAfLc/TXCZ3-HUoLM/s288/IMG_20140525_165345.jpg" alt="20140525235345, "><span data-time="1401062025" class="timestamp"><p>Around 5pm we tried to get drinks in Old Town at Ms Wong's, a Shanghai themed cocktail bar owned by a Kiwi. However, the bar opens at 6pm so were were too early. We walked around the Old French Quarter and the royal gardens park, sat outside a temple to the king and watched Cambodians arrive for some sort of festival. There was traditional music inside and people were arriving with lotus blossoms and cages full of birds. Kat says these birds are released as a sign of good will.</p><p>We walked back along the river, stopping to watch a large group exercising to music in a parking lot. We checked out the supermarket and found it to have no fresh food what so ever, I guess that type of food comes from the street markets. There was a Swensen's ice cream parlor however.</p><p>We made it back to Ms Wong's a little after 6pm. I ordered a Lemongrass Collins (vodka infused with lemongrass, ginger ale and vanilla syrup) and Katrina ordered an Indochine Martini with ginger and cognac, vodka and pineapple. Personally, I was not super impressed by the drinks, and think they were over-hyped on the web. I guess not every place can be Bourbon and Branch.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401069432" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-amX1vQEsFrs/VkoaOfXeWuI/AAAAAAAAfLc/L0nXpNqM2FI/s288/IMG_20140525_185712.jpg" alt="20140526015712, "><span data-time="1401069432" class="timestamp"><p>We had dinner after, going to Khmer Kitchen #3. We reordered the sour and coconut soup from our first meal, and enjoyed the fantastic flavors of sweet coconut, sour tamarind and kafir lime leaves, and spicy chili. Also tried the fresh spring rolls.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401070097" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-bOvFuY78u2s/VkoaOfICNKI/AAAAAAAAfLc/amEE51JI53s/s288/IMG_20140525_190817.jpg" alt="20140526020817, "><span data-time="1401070097" class="timestamp"><p>We got back to the hotel reasonably early. I borrowed the big knife from the bar again and cut and ate two mangoes. We now have four mangoes left!</p><p id="endOfEntry">&lt;End of Journal&gt;</p></span>

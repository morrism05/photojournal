<h2><a id="Kumano Kodo: Osaka to Takahara">Kumano Kodo: Osaka to Takahara</a></h2><h3><a id="1401519600">05/31/2014</a></h3><p>I was up before 7am and started my showering and final packing. Last night we had tried to put aside as much gear as possible to lighten our loads for the coming hike. I think I probably halved the weight of my bag. All of the excess gear was put into one of our pack duffels.</p><p>We checked out of the Cross Hotel and had them hold our excess gear until we return in six days. We then headed straight into the subway to get to Tennoji JR-Rail station. Katrina usually likes to get breakfast before we are moving in the morning, but we did not know exactly how much time we would need in Tennoji, so the plan was to do our ticketing first and then find some food.</p><p>At Tennoji station the woman behind the sales desk helped us with our one-way limited express, no-reserved-seats tickets to Kii-Tanabe. The tickets were about $43 each for the 1h 45m ride.</p><p>Tickets in hand we had about one hour before the 9:22am train. We checked in a number of cafes to see if the food agreed with us, most of the food had fish or meat. In fact, there was another egg pastry I was considering at a particular bakery, and so I used Google Translate to ask if it had any meat. The woman behind the counter consulted her colleague, who then informed me that it had "baaa-con". Oh well.</p><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401550646" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-U5zZhFEbyIQ/VibxuXiBKyI/AAAAAAAAam0/mBwjeNwXoXA/s288/P1480729.JPG" alt="20140531153726, "><span data-time="1401550646" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1401550646" class="timestamp"><p>We ended up eating at the Tree Cafe (there is a tree just inside the door when you arrive) and having a 500 yen set menu with an egg salad sandwich and a tea. I seem to remember eating lots of egg salad last time I was in Japan too. We have had pretty good success using credit cards at restaurants here in Japan, and I was able to charge this morning's breakfast too.</p><p>To get lunch supplies we looked around a mini-grocery store in the station. Most of the prepared foods were sushi style food with rice as the primary ingredient. We purchased red beans and rice balls, inari stuffed with red beans and rice, and some nuts. We tried to ask another customer for any pickled plum rice balls, but she was not able to understand what we wanted. Maybe we mispronounced umibashi?</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401552419" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_LWGibn6bL8/VibxuUT-GSI/AAAAAAAAam4/85JDPJ2CK_s/s288/P1480731.JPG" alt="20140531160659, "><span data-time="1401552419" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1401552419" class="timestamp"><p>We went to track 15 about ten minutes early to await out train. Some men who appeared to be railroad employees helped us find the unreserved seating cars. Only two of the six cars on our train are unreserved. We waited in the blue line painted on the platform. The train arrived on time (of course!) and we found two seats together on what would be the inland side of the train.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401554848" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Pn0cGJTClvM/VibxubNCJuI/AAAAAAAAam4/-vrOXFx0j60/s288/P1480737.JPG" alt="20140531164728, "><span data-time="1401554848" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1401554848" class="timestamp"><p>Our JR Kurosio Limited Express ran south onto the Kii peninsula. Our stop would be the forth. I spent the first half of the trip catching up on my journal, then looked out the window with Kat. After we left the Osaka metro area, the topography became mountainous with densely forested slopes. We passed many villages and cities in the valleys along rivers. The coastal cities appear to be in the oil refinery business. Most of the other activity we saw was in farming, with lots and lots of orchards (peaches or plums?) and some flooded rice fields. There were also some small vegetable patches. As our train got further and further from Osaka, we started seeing more traditional style wood houses instead of the plastered (concrete?) houses we see in the cities.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401559926" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-rO5PR_I-Hzc/VibxuVmJYmI/AAAAAAAAam4/53Rp0l_cbe0/s288/P1480753.JPG" alt="20140531181206, "><span data-time="1401559926" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1401559926" class="timestamp"><p>The train briefly ran right above the coast and minutes later we arrived in Tanabe. Katrina and I had very good documentation from the Tanabe City Kumano Tourism Bureau on where to find the bus which would take us to Takijiri (the start of our hike). The same website had links to schedules and even a How-To on riding buses in Japan. We knew we only had fifteen minutes to find the spot, so we hustled over to the bus stop on the side of the station and found stall #2. There was a reassuring sign in English which confirmed the bus schedule, destinations and costs. While I waited in line Katrina went into the tourist shop where she found the brochure version of the Kumano Kodo maps we had printed from PDFs. She was also able to prepurchase the bus fare.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401561268" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-iw30qJSWkoo/VibxuTv3A2I/AAAAAAAAam4/L64fNDx8mGE/s288/P1480757.JPG" alt="20140531183428, "><span data-time="1401561268" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1401561268" class="timestamp"><p>Per what we had learned, when the bus arrived we entered through the rear door and took a ticket. The ticket indicated which stop we had boarded the bus from. In the front of the bus above the windscreen there was an electric board with the numbers of all the stops on the route and the current fare if you got on at that stop and disembarked right now. We got on at stop 3 and we knew our fare was 930 yen. As the bus traveled its route we watched the fare from stop 3 grow and as it neared 930 we knew were were close.</p><p>The route itself went through Tanabe town, then when up a river valley and into the associated river canyon. Just before our Takijiri stop we passed a large landslide which had destroyed the original road. A temporary detour had been made by constructing one bridge to the far side of the river, a segment of road, and then a bridge back to the original road passed the slide.</p></span><span data-time="1401563517" class="timestamp"><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401563516" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_82ptp3uvBY/Vky31IkrRMI/AAAAAAAAfXg/A7rCsWSB6A0/s288/IMG_4181.JPG" alt="20140531191156, "><p>It was a little after noon when we got off at Takijiri. We looked around the hiker's visitor center, but we already had our maps so we did not need anything there. Thus, we went across the road to Takijiri-Oji shrine and ate our sushi items for lunch.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401565145" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-5I36Pz4G6u8/ViK834RXHWI/AAAAAAAAXq8/QUo3d3qibJo/s288/IMG_4182.JPG" alt="20140531193905, "><span data-time="1401565145" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1401565145" class="timestamp"><p>We are walking the Nakahechi route (the Royal route) of the Kumano Kodo pilgrimage trail, which starts at Takijiri. Today we have just 3.7km to hike before we make it to Takahara, the village of our ryokan. We started the hike at about 12:45 pm with a long climb up the mountain side. The path is extremely well marked, with many trail signs, signs indicating trails which are not part of the Kumano Kodo, mile markers (well the markers are actually 0.5km apart), and informational displays about the sites along the trail.</p><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401566306" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-WcNjqHZGDwM/Vky31JmfvwI/AAAAAAAAfXg/QPEQ9hieMsA/s288/P1480777.JPG" alt="20140531195826, "><p>Our first site of interest was the Tainai Kuguri cave. Signs explained that if you crawled into this cave and out the small hole on the far side, it was like passing through the birth canal. Those who passed this test would have easy childbirth. Katrina started to enter the cave to surmount the trial, but turned around when she spotted a large spider in the way. We did however get to see another hiker (an middle aged Japanese woman) crawl out of the opening.</p></span><span data-time="1401566842" class="timestamp"><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401566842" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-S1u2ZMZokI4/Vky31ERKDiI/AAAAAAAAfWs/uqgieKC-1Xo/s288/P1480784.JPG" alt="20140531200722, "><p>The trail continued climbing through the forest for most of the day. Sometimes it was rock steps and sometimes it was just tree roots which made the path. Our packs were the heaviest they have been on any hike, and we moved quite slowly.</p></span><span data-time="1401568161" class="timestamp"><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401568161" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-PCFJRMTa3Vc/Vky31HmXKwI/AAAAAAAAfXg/g1RUaeC8Q3E/s288/P1480792.JPG" alt="20140531202921, "><p>A few kilometers in the forest turned into cedar. Some selective logging had recently been done and so the air smelled sweet with cedar. We took a slight detour to see Lookout point. We could see a town down below, some of the highway, and the surrounding mountains. The mountains here are considerable in their steepness, if not all that tall. Today there is a thick smoggy haze in the air which prevents us from seeing very far. I blame China.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401569385" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-YC_LuaBZ35o/ViK833DWf4I/AAAAAAAAXrw/I-94xkGgtrw/s288/IMG_4193.JPG" alt="20140531204945, "><span data-time="1401569385" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1401569385" class="timestamp"><p>The climb got even steeper after the lookout point. As we walked we could hear cheering from down below in the town. I presume a high school baseball game was underway.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401570267" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-w3JqZ-F-LSk/VibxuVrGtaI/AAAAAAAAamo/Wbxh5TmntJM/s288/020-P1480806.JPG" alt="20140531210427, "><span data-time="1401570267" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1401570267" class="timestamp"><p>Near trail marker 5 we crossed a road and we spotted a youth on a bike taking photos. A troop of four monkeys was crossing the road. Thus, Laos will be the only country on our trip where we did not see monkeys. The monkeys disappeared in the direction of the Kumano Kodo trail. We rejoined the trail and found the Japanese woman from the birth rock walking slowly up the path with a stick in her hands. She told us "monkey". In very basic English I asked her if the monkeys were a threat "monkey bad? Monkey angry?" She replied "monkey dangerous."</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401571773" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--gj5ILclgak/ViK83zmNYvI/AAAAAAAAXnk/goFoTF07z4E/s288/IMG_4196.JPG" alt="20140531212933, "><span data-time="1401571773" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1401571773" class="timestamp"><p>The summit of the day's hike was at a radio tower, and then we started walking along a road into the village of Takahara Kiri-no-Sato. We ended up catching up to two more hikers and even the boy on the bike at the Takahara Kumano-jinja temple. The boy asked us where we were from, and we explained we were from San Francisco, America. The hiker man explained to us that the boy was a "high school boy". The boy then asked to take a photo with us in front of the temple. We cheerfully obliged. Katrina tells me that Mrs Koslov had French people asking her for photos when Mrs Koslov traveled France in the 1970's. I guess Americans are still a little rare or curious in Japan.</p><p>As we walked into the heart of town a car heading out of town stopped us and asked if we were heading to the Kiri-no-Sato guesthouse. We were. He explained that he was the hotel manager and he would be returning to the hotel around 3 pm, which was about 20 minutes from then.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401572549" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-z0zylyLht0c/ViK83yvJ7cI/AAAAAAAAXrU/wR4VDsUchNo/s288/IMG_4199.JPG" alt="20140531214229, "><span data-time="1401572549" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1401572549" class="timestamp"><p>We stopped in a little store and had an orange flavored mochi ball with an azuki bean filling. We chatted in broken English (them) and non-existent Japanese (us) about where we were from. The man in the store said "Golden Gate" when he heard we were from San Francisco, so I dug up a photo of the bridge on my phone to show him.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401573409" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-JmScSPd5hHw/VibxuWraypI/AAAAAAAAam4/B_Am1nLwvak/s288/P1480830.JPG" alt="20140531215649, "><span data-time="1401573409" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1401573409" class="timestamp"><p>We only arrived a few minutes before the hotel manager to our hotel. The hotel has a good sized restaurant and a long line of eight or so rooms that all have views into the valley, We have room #3 which is ten tatami mats large not even counting the entry and bathroom.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401581012" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-8jtjascIm_A/VibxuaPI9MI/AAAAAAAAamo/22Ad-7G5kd0/s288/026-P1480839.JPG" alt="20140601000332, "><span data-time="1401581012" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1401581012" class="timestamp"><p>Finding a drying rack in the entry, we washed our day's hiking clothes and set them on the porch to dry. We then dawned robes and headed to the communal bath rooms for our respective genders to have our first onsen experience.</p><p>The men's bathroom starts with an entry room where you can disrobe and put your clothes into a basket. Also in this room are a few sinks for fixing your hair. The next room is the washroom. On the left wall were four shower heads on hoses with associated stools and wash bowls. Here I washed up completely while sitting on the little stool. Actually, I don't know how to wash my rear when sitting, so I stood for that part! Clean (and careful to be completely rinsed of soap), I went to the right side of the room where a small rock pool full of hot-spring water is located. I sat and soaked for five or so minutes. The water was not so hot that I had to leave after five minutes, but I could tell that I was starting to sweat again from the heat. I had enough sweating on my hike today.</p><p>I met Kat back in the room and we compared stories of the bathrooms. They sound basically the same (the woman's tube is shaped differently). We both agreed that this was not a full onsen experience because we were both alone in while soaking. I guess not many Japanese are soaking at 3:30 pm!</p><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401581158" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-KQ8vuBpdhrg/Vky3Vd1ByVI/AAAAAAAAfXU/sCNdhGKr9bI/s288/P1480844.JPG" alt="20140601000558, "><p>Back in the room Katrina made our beds. All of the bedding material including the futon mats were in the closet and needed to be set out on the tatami mats. We then used the beds and wrote in our journals until dinner.</p></span><span data-time="1401585194" class="timestamp"><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401585194" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Q5THecTunn4/Vky3VRUvYyI/AAAAAAAAfXU/cbLczmDAO9w/s288/P1480846.JPG" alt="20140601011314, "><p>Dinner was at 6:30 pm, which was at the same time as the sunset. Our host, a flamboyant Japanese man with good English skills and a hint of French flare in him (much of the artwork is French here) was very excited to show us the sunset. When we came inside from the view the table was set with most of the cold courses for the evening. Later would come the hot courses, soups and desert. Here is what was served. Four types of pickled mountain vegetables including a mushroom (or maybe it was a long bean?), fiddle heads, spinach, and some sort of leak. A miso spinach mix. Snow peas. Radish with a dark miso sauce (we thought this sauce would have been perfect for eggplant). Peanut-based tofu with wasabi. Hot pot of dashi, mushroom, cabbage, tofu and dipping in sauce. Taro root jelly with white miso. Burdock root and seaweed. Green salad with bread crumbs and fantastic garden tomatoes. Steamed rice. Pickles for the rice. Chickpeas with peppers and tomatoes. Miso soup. Savory egg custard with mushrooms. Vegetable tempura. Terrific raspberry and wine sorbet. We added orange plum wine and hot sake. Depending on how you count, we had 19 dishes! Everything was very good, though we were startled that the food kept coming and coming. We once had a similar meal in Kyoto, but I don't think there were nearly as many courses! The spectrum of flavors mainly trended towards the savory and salty.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401591914" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-uU7LLikFJ-A/VibxubgK2RI/AAAAAAAAam0/sQqa6HEkYFQ/s288/P1480878.JPG" alt="20140601030514, "><span data-time="1401591914" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1401591914" class="timestamp"><p>The meal was not the only event of the evening. Our host (Jian?) had the piano tuned this afternoon and was very happy to learn that one of his other guests - Ben from Harvard (an American too I think) - was an accomplished pianist. Ben played slightly jazzy versions of My Romance, Consequences, Mack the Knife, and Over the Rainbow, the pianist's father Dan (a Japanese speaker, retired marathon runner, and Boston artist) sung the songs as a bass. They were a great pair, and they inspired a Japanese guest at another table to pull out a hand flute (not sure what the proper name of this pipe sized instrument is) and to join in to Over the Rainbow. Then, after the father and son had left the stage, the flutist took to the piano and his elderly female table-mate sung a beautiful soprano song.</p><p>What a show!</p><p id="endOfEntry">&lt;End of Journal&gt;</p></span></span>

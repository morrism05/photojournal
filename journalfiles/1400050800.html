Along the way we left the city limits of Bangkok and then passed field after field of rice and other crops like melons. It is before the planting season however, so not many fields had rice. To some extent this area reminds me of Florida; hot, humid and flat with lots of wetlands. There is a large network of canals which feed the farms and many houses are built on stilts to deal with the periodic flooring.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400082855" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-W5kht9VgacQ/ViJ6W4s-vII/AAAAAAAAUOc/2pbrt597h6Y/s288/P1460812.JPG" alt="20140514155415, "><span data-time="1400082855" class="timestamp"><p>All over Thailand (or at least the little bit of Thailand we have seen so far) there are dozens and dozens of wats. However, the ones in Ayutthaya date back to the 13th century. The first wat we visited was Wat Maha That. Like most of the wats we saw today, this one was constructed of bricks and covered in plaster. However, the wat was mostly destroyed in an earthquake in the 1950s, and then big floods three years ago have further damaged it. As such, what remains are tilting piles of bricks with a small amount of reconstructed plaster-work.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400083192" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-PUbeci-5FlM/ViJ6XCALRfI/AAAAAAAAUOc/3VnZ2HIMLHo/s288/IMG_3261.JPG" alt="20140514155952, "><span data-time="1400083192" class="timestamp"><p>Dom told us how sometime in the past the armies of Burma ransacked this temple and, knowing that heads of statues of Buddha are sometimes filled with gold, knocked the heads off of all the statues on the site. One of the statue heads was left behind and eventually it was gathered into the root system of bodhi tree. Since this is the same type of tree that Buddha reached enlightenment under, this tree and stone head have now become an important site in Thailand.</p><p>Even though it was only 9:30am when we left Wat Maha That, we were already sticky with sweat. Our day today was like a hot day in Florida. Temperatures in the 80s and 90s F, and lots and lots of humidity. Every time we returned to the van from our stop, the driver had cold waters and cold towel wipes ready for us. This was a nice interlude between the visits.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400085006" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-gTb7LG36DYA/ViJ6WzTf6eI/AAAAAAAAUOc/g0W2Gc0pXsw/s288/P1460829.JPG" alt="20140514163006, "><span data-time="1400085006" class="timestamp"><p>The second stop was Wat Phrasisanpenth. This temple site was where the Thai royals had their ashes buried back 500 years ago. The complex many small temples and a half dozen large ones; only the large ones were fully intact in our visit, as they had been recently reconstructed. These temples are bell-shaped with pointy conical spires.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400086920" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-rlS6UFqTqh0/ViJ6W4H8ImI/AAAAAAAAUOc/ADs-cjvslHI/s288/P1460842.JPG" alt="20140514170200, "><span data-time="1400086920" class="timestamp"><p>Adjacent is Phra Mongkhon Bophit, and very large bronze Buddha statue. This was the first functioning holy site we entered today, and as is the custom we had to remove our shoes and hats before entering. The massive Buddha is a sight to behold, as it was recently recovered in gold leaf. We watched and Buddhists came in, gave payer to the statue, made a small monetary offering, then shook an open-ended can of chopsticks until one fell out. The chopstick that fell would have a number on it, and from this number the worshiper cloud lookup and learn his fortune.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400088501" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Y_dIIluRL30/ViJ6W2KjSCI/AAAAAAAAUOc/_V7ISZaT9Tg/s288/P1460848.JPG" alt="20140514172821, "><span data-time="1400088501" class="timestamp"><p>After visiting the Buddha we went into the adjacent farmers' market. Dom bought us bamboo fans and some sort of local crepe and cotton candy treat. The crepe is a rice flour pancake which is made by touching a ball of dough to a large round hotplate. A portion of the dough will stick to the plate when the ball is removed, and that becomes the crepe. Then, into the crepe is rolled thread or hairlike strands of sugar candy. Going against out anti-sugar tendencies, we tried this sweet treat and found it to be very much in the flavor line of carnival foods.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400091690" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-HL4uo9ugXyE/ViJ6XHW3TkI/AAAAAAAAUOc/KUJ6_kMTIAQ/s288/IMG_3294.JPG" alt="20140514182130, "><span data-time="1400091690" class="timestamp"><p>We got back in the van and drove about 30 minutes to the Summer Palace of the Thai royal family. This site is still owned by the royal family, but is infrequently used and is more often opened to tourists. We went through the park like grounds with Dom (sweltering in the noon heat and gulping bottled water), and visited the many memorial buildings and functional buildings on the site.</p><p>The first stop was at an over-water pavilion which memorialized the drowning of the King's wife and child. There was a time where it was forbidden for anyone to touch a royal. When the queen and child fell into the water and did not know how to swim, no one could come to their rescue and thus they drowned.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400092377" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-2D5aFQN_u0E/ViJ6W6yrcbI/AAAAAAAAUOc/qBs5H5jDJls/s288/P1460857.JPG" alt="20140514183257, "><span data-time="1400092377" class="timestamp"><p>Next we walked by one of the large functional palaces which was in European style. The Kings of Thailand have had much contact with Europe and drawn much inspiration from there. In fact, the gardens in this site had a European feel, and I learned that Thailand's modernity of infrastructure also came from a drive to be equal with the West.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400092729" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--VByP8HXLyw/ViJ6W3sbCsI/AAAAAAAAUOc/RupCHPeWoHk/s288/P1460862.JPG" alt="20140514183849, "><span data-time="1400092729" class="timestamp"><p>While the European inspired palace was closed to visitors, we were able to enter a Chinese inspired palace. This palace was built by sending fine Thai wood (mahogany I think) to Chinese craftsmen who created the pieces for the palace and shipped them back to Thailand. The palace was then assembled. The palace is red and gold per Chinese tradition and has numerous dragon motifs. The furniture inside was made of ebony with opalescent inlays. This building both had a throne room for conducting business and a bedroom for the king.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400095601" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-OhpOjjQMsWw/ViJ6W43P82I/AAAAAAAAUOY/ay0zGaIX_6M/s288/P1460880.JPG" alt="20140514192641, "><span data-time="1400095601" class="timestamp"><p>The last building we entered was a reception hall. To enter this building Katrina was required to wear a long traditional Thai skirt, which Dom borrowed from the tourist office. Dom also taught Katrina the Thai hand positions for dance.</p><p>After leaving the winter palace we heard how the current king and queen are old and it is not clear who their successor will be. There are four children (three women and one man) to the couple and the Thai people are waiting to find out which will be picked as the heir to the throne. Some people hope one of the daughters will be picked over the son, as the son is seen as a bit of a playboy.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400098979" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-s6CXPtGz-7Q/ViJ6XPubhcI/AAAAAAAAUOc/FYQYRmFDu3w/s288/IMG_3302.JPG" alt="20140514202259, "><span data-time="1400098979" class="timestamp"><p>For our final event of the day we boarded a river cruise which would take us back to Bangkok. The boat was full of other tourists too. We were given a table and access to the buffet tables for lunch. My favorite item were the little mango sticky rice deserts.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400099734" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-H2Ll5bbr4tc/ViJ6XBLLWFI/AAAAAAAAUOc/e8EruFJ8y2E/s288/IMG_3303.JPG" alt="20140514203534, "><span data-time="1400099734" class="timestamp"><p>We watched the river shore go by. Mostly there were houses and businesses on stilts along the river. Traditional Thai housing in this area is built on stilts to cope with the frequent flooding. We also passed a number of wats and quite a few compounds owned by the royal family.</p><p>Once the boat entered the Bangkok city limits we started seeing more skyrise condos and large institutions like military headquarters, hospitals and factories. One hospital was noted as being the place where women can go to become beautiful and men can go to become women. Apparently $7k US will get you a sex change to become a woman. With regards to the condos, while foreigners are not allowed to our a majority stake in any landholding, they are allowed complete ownership of condos. This probably explains the expensive condo market.</p><p>After the boat tour our van driver picked us up and fought through traffic to get us back to the Tai-Pan hotel. The traffic was bad because of a combination of early rush hour and protest related delays.</p><p>I was a bit heat exhausted by the end of the tour day, and so we rested in the hotel for a while while the sun set. After dark we returned to the street to walk down the main boulevard to Soi 1 (side street 1) to find the vegetarian restaurant Na Aroon. At this time of the evening the main boulevard was busy with commuting traffic and the night market stalls had set up on the sidewalk. The stalls were continuous rows of DVDs, knock-off t-shirts, sun glasses and watches, and sex-related items like dildos and Viagra. (Today the Soi Cowboy street with all of its strip clubs was open again - yesterday it was closed for a national holiday. We did not walk Soi Cowboy but there was a thick crowd on the street.) The street market stalls were a bit overwhelming for someone who was just trying to get to dinner, as traffic would block-up when people stopped to look at the merchandise.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400121797" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-CV3ut9S9ldI/ViJ6W5k3DfI/AAAAAAAAUOY/U9zXh0aM8iA/s288/P1460920.JPG" alt="20140515024317, "><span data-time="1400121797" class="timestamp"><p>We eventually made it to Na Aroon, which is located in a stylish hotel. We were the only guests during our dinner (two more came in after us), but the waitstaff was very friendly and helpful. We first had a peanut salad wrap appetizer (on the house), then had Thai spring rolls which appeared to be using tofu as the wrapper and contained egg, then a pad dish with green papaya instead of noodles, and finally a mussaman curry. The main dishes were particularly good, although Katrina noted that the mussaman curry was a bit like the the Nepali curries we had eaten so much of - perhaps a green curry would have been a better change of pace. I found the food the be spicy but not very spicy. I think we need to ask one of our guides to order curry for us without letting the kitchen know we are westerners. I would love to know how spicy Thai food is when cooked for a Thai consumer.</p><p>(There were also a few mosquitoes flying around at the restaurant. We did not get bit but it made me nervous!)</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400126247" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-P9HVU13thJI/ViJ6W2OoflI/AAAAAAAAUOc/qdZXcu-36L4/s288/P1460926.JPG" alt="20140515035727, "><span data-time="1400126247" class="timestamp"><p>We walked back to the room via the same route. We were surprised by how many Arab people were out on the sidewalks. Men, women in burkas, and children were walking the night market. Katrina later learned that at Soi 3 there is a Arab community.</p><p>The other group of people that we continue to see and who continue to stand out are aging white men. There are many many more gray haired and round bellied white men on the streets than there are white women of the same age. About half of these men are walking with younger Thai women who I presume are in their 30s or so. This is evidence I presume of the many American men who come to Asia and especially Thailand to find a bride.</p><p>We returned to the hotel and went to sleep.</p><p id="endOfEntry">&lt;End of Journal&gt;</p></span>

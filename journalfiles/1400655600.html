We woke up reasonably well rested (sleeping under a mosquito net is still not first nature to us) and then went to breakfast in the hotel restaurant. The restaurant is open to the air and looks down the hill, over the pretty swimming pool and out over the gardens to the Nam Khan River. Really, because the gardens and grounds are filled with trees, you cannot see the river and it looks like you are looking out over jungle. For breakfast we had fried eggs, fruit, muesli and yogurt, croissant and toast. The croissant was quite good, so the French must have left the recipe behind!</p><span data-time="1400683423" class="timestamp"><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400683114" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Ssx4Mh0X17U/VkoafSzYNMI/AAAAAAAAfKM/Ngei7ZDRmtE/s288/P1470582.JPG" alt="20140521143834, "><p>We then walked down through the gardens to the edge of the resort property. There are many flowers and fruit trees on the property. The property ends at the cliffs over the Nam Khan River, and has views of the Old Bridge and the hilltop temple.</p><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400688307" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-RGP3FyLLX4I/VkoafUo4XlI/AAAAAAAAfKM/JygCKxNbFqY/s288/P1470593.JPG" alt="20140521160507, "><p>At about 8:45 am Katrina dropped of some laundry to be washed by the hotel and then we waited in the lobby for our guide. Ken showed up shortly and we went into old town to the National Museum. This museum is on the old palace grounds.</p></span><span data-time="1400688346" class="timestamp"><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400688335" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-tV53Szt8_24/VkoafX-kZ2I/AAAAAAAAfKM/cKdz5VbM41A/s288/P1470594.JPG" alt="20140521160535, "><p>The first thing we saw was the newly refurbished temple. Inside the temple is a Buddha statue which is said to contain ashes of Buddha himself. The statue was made in Sri Lanka, ended up in the hands of the King of Cambodia, and then was given to the King of Laos (son-in-law to the Cambodian King) as a gift. There is some debate over this story though, and the original statue may still be in Cambodia or may be in Thailand.</p><p>Next Ken told us a little bit of Laos history. During the early 20th century the French controlled Laos. They supported the king and kept him and his family happy. (They did not do much for the common people though.) It was at the turn of the 20th century that the French built the King of Laos this palace here in Luang Prabang.</p><p>The line of Lao Kings was in power until just after the Vietnam War. The French had left Laos after WWII and during the Vietnam War America was very active in Laos trying to bomb the Ho Chi Min trial and kill communist leaders (both Vietnamese and Lao) who were hiding along the Laos/Vietnam border. Most of the Lao tribes supported the Communist effort. Thus, when the Vietnam War ended and the Communists had won, the King turned to the one tribe the Hmong who supported the monarchy over communism. Unfortunately for the King most of the Hmong had been driven out of Laos by this point and so the King could not rally a comeback. He died of malaria in the mountains in the 1970s, and none of his children tried to succeed him. At this point Laos became unambiguously communist. (Later, they became socialist so that Lao people could own property.)</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400689078" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-oLzJgaemlZo/ViKVCV1PIWI/AAAAAAAAVko/WCNNPEhsql0/s288/IMG_3688.JPG" alt="20140521161758, "><span data-time="1400689078" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1400689078" class="timestamp"><p>The palace here has French and Lao architectural cues. While the main reception room is ornately decorated and has some bright mirrored mosaic work, the palace is actually pretty modest.</p></span><span data-time="1400693444" class="timestamp"><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400693330" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-2grcpMbYwTY/Vkoafa4UzmI/AAAAAAAAfKM/9Gd_9vp3kHk/s288/P1470607.JPG" alt="20140521172850, "><p>From the palace we walked down the street to the Wat Mai. We looked at its bright gold and red architecture but did not learn too much about the temple.</p></span><span data-time="1400695869" class="timestamp"><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400695454" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-DVprJuSa9-s/VkoafQntNXI/AAAAAAAAfKM/ZVe3SONm12c/s288/P1470628.JPG" alt="20140521180414, "><p>We got back in our van and headed out of the city for the Kuangsi Waterfall Park. The drive was about 37 km long, wound through farming country and past a number of villages. Beyond the rice and corn fields, there were also many teak plantations. Ken says that the teak actually takes 25 years of growing before it can be harvested.</p></span><span data-time="1400697274" class="timestamp"><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400697201" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-q6eYJJdjxvc/VkoafaUo2vI/AAAAAAAAfKM/sn3sfzm037M/s288/P1470638.JPG" alt="20140521183321, "><p>The Kuangsi Waterfall Park is certainly the most beautiful thing we have seen in Laos. We started at the topmost waterfall, a several hundred foot tall, multi-tiered cascade. Ken was astonished by how few people were around this morning. We did not have the park to ourselves, but we certainly got in a few shots of the water without any tourists in the frame!</p><p>The water here is a milky blue color, and is ripe with minerals which have settled in the riverbed and formed fantastic terraces of cascading pools. It looks like something out of Disney or maybe out of a storybook!</p></span><span data-time="1400700030" class="timestamp"><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400699539" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-9f_bQb2BMkw/VkoafVdV03I/AAAAAAAAfKE/TLRyO7JCqSI/s288/P1470677.JPG" alt="20140521191219, "><p>I wanted to hike up the mid-level of the tall waterfall to get another viewpoint. We started up the right-side path, but got no more than 25' when some tourists coming down the other way told us that a snake was in the path and had forced them to go back. Thus, we tried the left-side path and after about 200' some other tourists coming down the path told us that there was no view at the top! We continued upwards a little further anyhow, and got some obstructed views of the mid-level of the waterfall and some vistas out over the mountains and jungle.</p></span><span data-time="1400700916" class="timestamp"><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400700898" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-mO5QRthjytI/VkoafeK54cI/AAAAAAAAfKM/HeYcp9OqWGY/s288/P1470688.JPG" alt="20140521193458, "><p>Only a few of the pools on the stream are open for swimming. We started at the topmost pool, and were in awe of the beautiful mineral terraces, the 3'-8' tall mini waterfalls, the blue waters and refreshing temperature. We spent lots of time taking pictures from the water, and more time swimming about in this upper pool. My favorite place in the upper pool was at the cascade that fed the pool. From here you could stand on a rock and look back upstream at a stack of eight or so mini pools topped by a broad waterfall. With the jungle green on all sides and butterflies fluttering around, it was magical. The only thing slightly unpleasant about the experience was that the fish in the water would nip at your feet if you were still. I kicked extra vigorously while swimming around to scare them away!</p><p>We explored the lower two swimming polls but were not as enticed to enter them, so we went back to the top pools.</p><p>Although the park rules forbid bare chests (for men) and bikini swimsuits, there were plenty of both among st the Western tourists at Kuangsi. The Lao visitors were mostly more modest, and swam in shorts and a t-shirt. Some of them even went in in full pants!</p><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400710028" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Mb0jlN1m1kE/Vkoafb6Am-I/AAAAAAAAfKM/gEIgqTEIFC8/s288/P1470775.JPG" alt="20140521220708, "><p>Around 3pm we left the waterfalls and went back into town. Ken dropped us off at Le Cafe Ban Vat Sene, which is actually a sister restaurant to the Coconut Garden from last night. Having not had lunch yet we were super hungry and so Kat ordered a Lao Cuisine tasting menu and I ordered a panini. It turned out her meal was five entrees large, with two big bowls of soup, a mushroom stir-fry, steamed veggies with tomato dipping sauce, fried rice and sticky rice! It was all tasty but we struggled to finish our food and ultimately some went to waste.</p></span><span data-time="1400716037" class="timestamp"><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400715339" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-4Qu9QZTKOUA/Vkoafchr9YI/AAAAAAAAfKM/U7JuIyUqj0w/s288/P1470781.JPG" alt="20140521233539, "><p>We walked the few blocks to Vat Xieng Thong and explored it on our own. Ken had referred to this wat as the most extraordinary wat in Laos, and in fact this wat is on the Lao money the Kip. What is beautiful about wat and its many smaller temples is that they are decorated in tinted pieces of mirror that have been arrayed in mosaics and tell the stories of Buddhism. It makes for a very bright and colorful experience; I particularly liked one little temple with purple tiles.</p></span><span data-time="1400718612" class="timestamp"><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400718479" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-5V9Xn3n52-w/VkoafY9cQnI/AAAAAAAAfKM/qYAROjCMcn0/s288/P1470850.JPG" alt="20140522002759, "><p>As we finished at Vat Xieng Thong the sun was beginning to set, we exited the grounds on its Mekong side and watched the riverbanks change color. There was a bright gaggle of novice monks on the far bank that were fun to photograph, especially when they started walking back towards us via the bamboo pedestrian bridge over the mouth of the Nam Khan river.</p></span><span data-time="1400722205" class="timestamp"><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400720140" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-hrjy3l1S6rU/VkoafXB9hnI/AAAAAAAAfKM/2XmIGurCrT0/s288/P1470889.JPG" alt="20140522005540, "><p>We walked back into to town and through the night market. It is filled with tasteful but touristy souvenirs. We saw a set of pillow cases we had purchased during our Li Jiang vacation. I guess most of this stuff is factory made!</p><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400721522" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-shV9Wn3GyBc/VkoafZ7RSSI/AAAAAAAAfKE/4OSfp5YPnAE/s288/P1470909.JPG" alt="20140522011842, "><p>We also walked through an ally which is the night food market. River weed was for sale, as was some dried item called tuberculosis; someone should retranslate that! There were a number of stalls that had 20 or so prepared dishes and for $2 you could fill a plate with whatever you liked.</p><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400721931" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ExS69tTi5Nc/Vkoafd4LHmI/AAAAAAAAfKM/tBcvWjry7Qk/s288/P1470914.JPG" alt="20140522012531, "><p>Walking through old Luang Prabang often reminds me of being in the Caribbean. The weather is hot and sticky, there are palm trees everywhere, and many of the buildings are whitewashed colonials.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400722650" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Y-OHXofSLes/ViKVCRgKbgI/AAAAAAAAVkk/v8eyeZg0Vjs/s288/IMG_3848.JPG" alt="20140522013730, "><span data-time="1400722650" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1400722650" class="timestamp"><p>Thirsty, Katrina bought a massive coconut from some elementary schoolgirls who were running a smoothie stand and we drank the water with straws.

We cleaned up and wrote in our journals before bed.</p><p id="endOfEntry">&lt;End of Journal&gt;</p></span></span>

We went down for breakfast at 8:30am. The selection was complete but not gourmet. We had the typical cheese and tomato sandwiches, yogurt with fruit and muesli, and pastry. Behind the desk at the restaurant was an elderly lady that looked like she was Sabine's mother. The wall behind the desk also had many trophies and pictures of Sabine.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363537906" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-VPBVCfef0-8/VhgpJAhECqI/AAAAAAAAJR0/P7BUUoQMRlo/s288/P1410751.JPG" alt="20130317163146, "><span data-time="1363537906" class="timestamp"><p>After breakfast, we walked around the block to see if there were any viewpoints onto the track - there weren't really - and to see what was in town - a church, the BMW M tech center, and Rent4Ring racecar rentals.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363539918" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--sB_aakUhGw/VhgpVLp1DDI/AAAAAAAAJTs/S5DJzgEP-7I/s288/P1410769.JPG" alt="20130317170518, "><span data-time="1363539918" class="timestamp"><p>We left Hotel Am Tiergarten and drove to various view points. First, we passed by the large mall and casino complex which bankrupted the 'Ring. I could not tell if it was open or not. Then, we found where one of the local roads intersected the straight between Hocheichen and Flugplatz. I walled along the track's fence and found and open gate, so I walked on the snow covered track. Hocheichen corner leading to the straight was tighter than I imagined and also drops down and to the left very quickly here. I walked around a small segment of track imagining I was driving the line and then went back to our car.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363542012" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-4teiY2OL5E8/VhgptYyNIdI/AAAAAAAAJXM/9788tV_29Qg/s288/P1410798.JPG" alt="20130317174012, "><span data-time="1363542012" class="timestamp"><p>We drove to the turns of Adenau and Exmuhle, the lowest point on the circuit. This is a segment which I feel is poorly modeled in my racing game, and I was very surprised by the steep and banked climb of Exmuhle. It is not quite as steep as the Laguna Seca Corkscrew, but is getting there. Again, the access to the track was unimpeded, so I walked this part of the track too. The inside of this uphill right hander is banked for speed, but as you track out to the left the banking disappears. Perhaps this is why I am prone to spinning here!</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363544556" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-zOw0mEvHLp4/Vhgp_rdUq0I/AAAAAAAAJZs/A6Zaex29ABA/s288/P1410818.JPG" alt="20130317182236, "><span data-time="1363544556" class="timestamp"><p>We made additional visits the tourist entry gate (locked and empty), then to the Pflanzgarten jumps and the viewpoint gallery where all of the spy photos are taken. There were other men stopping at these viewpoints and tromping in the snow to look at the track. It was both exciting to see and walk the famed Nordscheife and disappointing to have had snow ruin my trackday plans.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363548839" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ZuAgz0xGLhQ/VhgqMm3Y5MI/AAAAAAAAJbY/LzxgOhx5FiI/s288/P1410831.JPG" alt="20130317193359, "><span data-time="1363548839" class="timestamp"><p>We left Nurburg for the Mosel Valley under the Europa bridge to look at old wine terraces. The terraces are all built on the south facing slope and are serviced by little rickety monorails (like those we saw in the Cinque Terre). We then followed the Mosel to its intersection of the Rhine in Koblenz. We walked quiet Koblenz, got lunch at a friendly and serviceable Mexican restaurant, and explored the basilica from 800 AD.</p><p>We left Koblenz and drove along the Rhine River to Boppard. Here I drove up into the hills to test the car on twisting roads. The BMW 320d comes a bit more alive when under pressure to perform, with its quick turn in response, solid cornering control, and torquey pick up. Still, the car's steering lacks feedback to tell you if you are approaching the limits of the capable chasis. The steering is too quiet and disconnected in this regard. The car is very neutral at 7/10ths, even with the xDrive AWD. In summary, the car is comfortable, capable and fast, but lacks involvement due to the steering feel and diesel engine's characteristics. On the autobahn, the car's chassis is clearly unchallenged by this diesel engine, and could handle much higher speeds.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363560073" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_OXZl64a-8M/Vhgqd8NDgTI/AAAAAAAAJd0/OQVYfcLYs3k/s288/P1410854.JPG" alt="20130317224113, "><span data-time="1363560073" class="timestamp"><p>In Boppard we parked and checked out the remains an old Roman city wall. Katrina was very excited by this piece of history. We also quickly walked the town and were impressed by the number of people out on a Sunday and by the fact they seemed to all know each other.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363562505" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-vSKPcJHOwJE/Vhgqj9u9ZdI/AAAAAAAAJeo/U3g5XdZ5GXk/s288/P1410860.JPG" alt="20130317232145, "><span data-time="1363562505" class="timestamp"><p>At last we arrived at the castle hotel Schoneburg in Oberwesel. It is perched in an astonishing location over the Rhine river on a hill with cliff like flanks. We accesed the parking lot via a wooden bridge, then walked through the stone gate to the inner courtyard and reception. A costumed maid led us tour to our room, #21 on the third floor. The room is spectacular, with wood paneling on the walls, bookshelves running along the ceiling, and hidden doors for the closet and access to the outside walk of the castle wall! The coffee table had sherry and apples for our enjoyment, the fridge was stocked with water, juice and beer. Tried the locally made sherry - yummy. From our windows we can see down to the Rhine its tight banks and busy barge traffic.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363567419" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-vdH4LY_fUvM/ViFjQZWGOrI/AAAAAAAAKOQ/FDuCUWhNPXI/s288/IMG_20130317_124339.jpg" alt="20130318004339, "><span data-time="1363567419" class="timestamp"><p>After exploring the castle's library, sitting rooms, and tower room, we had tea by the fireplace.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363572295" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-vUH6kJtuiiA/ViFjQQSzSjI/AAAAAAAAKOM/fC-8YgiHqz4/s288/IMG_20130317_140455.jpg" alt="20130318020455, "><span data-time="1363572295" class="timestamp"><p>So we could further enjoy the location, we had dinner at the onsite restaurant. We tried one of each of the available vegetarian dishes - white tomato soup, lamb's lettuce salad, and a truffle cream spaghetti. All the dishes were wonderful. As usual, we had trouble figuring out how to get the check.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363578712" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-4CyjYaup2ao/VhgrF9OapyI/AAAAAAAAJjM/PR_BNPyV060/s288/P1410904.JPG" alt="20130318035152, "><span data-time="1363578712" class="timestamp"><p>We returned to our room to thoroughly enjoy it some more, then headed to bed.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363578810" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Bmcqo0hhPFU/VhgrJ6K4XiI/AAAAAAAAJjk/kxz9TIP1fYM/s288/P1410906.JPG" alt="20130318035330, "><span data-time="1363578810" class="timestamp"><p id="endOfEntry">&lt;End of Journal&gt;</p></span>

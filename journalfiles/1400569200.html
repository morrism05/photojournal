This is a real shame as the bed was actually pretty comfortable.</p><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400591458" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-jbfyPOF9M-g/Vib2HBNQTII/AAAAAAAAa0s/OplOf3BvSpM/s288/P1470408.JPG" alt="20140520131058, "><span data-time="1400591458" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1400591458" class="timestamp"><p>We got up sometime shortly after sunrise and enjoyed the view of the morning sky. Then we dressed and packed our bags. Before 7am the two women porters who had carried our bags off the boat yesterday were waiting (uncalled for!) on our porch. Even though I would have been fine carrying my own bag, I felt cold-hearted to send them away, so I used their services.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400594877" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7KxA_eG7ZN8/Vib2HBrtqEI/AAAAAAAAa0s/WamUyMIlBoo/s288/P1470417.JPG" alt="20140520140757, "><span data-time="1400594877" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1400594877" class="timestamp"><p>We had breakfast of fried eggs, mango sticky rice, flan and toast in the hotel restaurant, and a bit before 8am we boarded the boat and started downstream again.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400596214" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-guBesaJg9g8/Vib2HLnN1OI/AAAAAAAAa0s/STLBK6DFy-s/s288/P1470419.JPG" alt="20140520143014, "><span data-time="1400596214" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1400596214" class="timestamp"><p>The main difference in the scenery this morning was that the river's water-level had risen considerably. La told us that there is a Chinese dam upstream, and that the dam will release water when a Chinese ship needs to deliver goods downstream to Laos and needs more river depth. I would guess that the river was at least 3' higher today.</p><p>The scenery of hills forest and farms continued today as yesterday. We learned that 80% of Lao people are subsistence farmers. La's grandfather was a farmer but not La's parents. One curious cultural fact we learned was that in Lao families it this the youngest child who has the responsibility of staying at home and caring for the parents. In return, the youngest child is given the homestead and its land. La is the youngest in his family, so he supports his retired father and (not retired) mother.</p><p>We also learned from La about the wedding traditions here. Lao weddings are very large with 500 to 1,000 guests, and the cost of the wedding is placed on the groom. Nowadays sometimes the bride pays some of the cost. After the couple is married, the couple is expected to move into the bride's parents' village for 2-3 years. During this time the groom is to do whatever projects her parents want of him. At the end of the 3 years, the couple moves into the groom's parents' village and the bride is expected to work on the behalf of the groom's parents indefinitely!</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400605945" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XFDHMAmNAy4/Vib2HGBbT4I/AAAAAAAAa0s/-5e3EcI0krE/s288/P1470440.JPG" alt="20140520171225, "><span data-time="1400605945" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1400605945" class="timestamp"><p>Our first stop of the day was at a low-land tribe's village. This village has been around for about 25 years. It looks more established than yesterday's village with the houses surrounded by more mature trees. The village did not have the nest of electrical wires from yesterday's village, so maybe only a few houses here have electricity?</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400606032" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-yc8b4-As5Pk/ViKVCRV5mEI/AAAAAAAAVko/zm0IWhW4COA/s288/IMG_3583.JPG" alt="20140520171352, "><span data-time="1400606032" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1400606032" class="timestamp"><p>The village has a good sized Buddhist temple, but because the villagers are animists instead and did not give alms to the monks, the temple is now unmanned. La explained to us some of the painted stories on the temple.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400606578" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-gEopjbJEYZI/Vib2HNGy9MI/AAAAAAAAa0s/w_a30Y75Dwg/s288/P1470444.JPG" alt="20140520172258, "><span data-time="1400606578" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1400606578" class="timestamp"><p>As we walked around the villagers has set out weaving and wood workings for us to view and buy. Multiple houses had looms under them. The locally woven cloth was pretty plain and just had stripes of color. La told us that the highly detailed patterns probably indicated factory made cloth. We did not end up buying anything.</p><p>As were were leaving the village there was a gaggle of children watching a man throw a hammer-like wooden tool at a mango tree, trying to knock mangoes loose. It seemed to be working and he had collected four or five mango.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400607973" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-8DboQER269U/Vib2HC0wacI/AAAAAAAAa0s/VtEZJanHj58/s288/P1470458.JPG" alt="20140520174613, "><span data-time="1400607973" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1400607973" class="timestamp"><p>We continued downstream and soon were served lunch. There was more yummy egg curry, stir fried vegetables, and noodles with egg. I have been enjoying the curries.</p><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400611827" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-0sT2l3vwlD0/Vkoaff_7kAI/AAAAAAAAfJ8/KLvGVxzcp7Q/s288/P1470468.JPG" alt="20140520185027, "><p>As we worked our way east the hills grew in size and became steeper. We started to come to places where the hills had not been farmed because the soil on the steep slopes was very thin and mostly rock. This made for lush green forests in our views. The hills changed to limestone and granite, and a few of them rose sharply as the hills on the Li River near Yangshao did when we were in China. Just like yesterday, today the skies were crystal clear blue with white puffy clouds floating by. This was the most beautiful portion of our day.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400617756" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-1jb9La3Uxk8/ViKVCYwG9hI/AAAAAAAAVko/gsXvRGNuah8/s288/IMG_3636.JPG" alt="20140520202916, "><span data-time="1400617756" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1400617756" class="timestamp"><p>Eventually we pulled up to one limestone cliff opposite of Pak Ou. In the cliff was the Cave of a Thousand Buddhas. People have been coming to this cave and leaving Buddha statues and figurines. They are of all sizes - some larger than life and some as small as a coin. La says that the higher up in the cave you put your Buddha the better luck you will get. He also explained how the different postures that the Buddha figurines have correspond to different wishes that people may have (good health, prosperity, patience, etc).</p><p>We explored the lower cave and then climbed a long staircase to the upper cave. The upper cave was much deeper, so we were given flashlights when we entered. There was a smaller number of Buddas in this cave.</p><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400620400" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Lq1DGE_397k/VkoafYQDyAI/AAAAAAAAfJ8/AMQULFeX3HU/s288/P1470526.JPG" alt="20140520211320, "><p>Looking out of the caves and back across the river at Pak Ou was particularly pretty, and the clear Ou river was mixing with the muddy Mekong and the green limestone mountains towered behind.</p></span><span data-time="1400620400" class="timestamp"><p>We got back in the boat and in about 30 minutes we were alongside the greater Luang Prabang area. Large luxurious houses dotted the elevated riverside, peaking out of the trees. Just after the mouth of the Nam Khan river we docked and disembarked. A staircase led up the hill to one of the main streets of old Luang Prabang, and here we said goodbye to La and waited for our driver (we were earlier in arrival than usual for the boat).</p><p>Our ICS driver did arrive about 5 minutes later, but our guide was not with him. We took a long route out of the old city and across the Nam Khan river before we found the My Dream Hotel. Our local guide Ken was waiting for us at the hotel. He apologized for not being there to greet us at the dock (he expected us to arrive one hour later as is typical of the boat). He then oriented us in the city and told us about the plan for tomorrow.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400626542" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-f0KWzRU6pgo/Vib2HAqWpnI/AAAAAAAAa0s/Xs7pwMPRC8Y/s288/P1470538.JPG" alt="20140520225542, "><span data-time="1400626542" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1400626542" class="timestamp"><p>Kat and I checked into our room, and showered. (We have been showering multiple times a day in Thailand and Laos, since it is so sticky when we get back from our tours around 3:30pm and then when we get back after dinner we want to clean off all the bug spray from the evening.) We got dressed and then headed for the old town again.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400632176" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ZfoheBDS5fk/Vib2HBvX_PI/AAAAAAAAa0s/PI9qTYH6n_w/s288/P1470545.JPG" alt="20140521002936, "><span data-time="1400632176" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1400632176" class="timestamp"><p>It turns out that nearby to our hotel is the old bridge over the Nam Khan and that this bridge can be used by motorcycles, bikes and walkers but not cars. We walked this bridge back to the city (it was rickety and a little scary!) and then walked our way back to the Mekong riverfront.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400633315" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-VNv-CTvFO_w/Vib2HPpm97I/AAAAAAAAa0s/NLm1amRhbDY/s288/P1470550.JPG" alt="20140521004835, "><span data-time="1400633315" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1400633315" class="timestamp"><p>Along the way we passed a lot of commerce going on on the sidewalks. People had set out chairs and tables and were hovering over a laminated piece of paper with pictures of animals and tables of numbers. Then, they had a carbon-copy pad which looked like they could make receipts from. I think they were selling some sort of tickets for a lottery but I am not sure! There were also food and produce vendors along the streets.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400634276" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-OOG_zHKEbw4/Vib2HCAFIXI/AAAAAAAAa0s/74GAY8iGZRY/s288/P1470554.JPG" alt="20140521010436, "><span data-time="1400634276" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1400634276" class="timestamp"><p>Katrina had looked up the name of a Mekong river-side restaurant that was supposed to be vegetarian friendly. We found the old location of that restaurant, but it seemed to be under new management and under a new name. The waitress was not so interested in helping us so we left.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400634829" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-4-ipyfGDbxw/Vib2HAnSFSI/AAAAAAAAa0s/fiIxo-5HYUg/s288/P1470556.JPG" alt="20140521011349, "><span data-time="1400634829" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1400634829" class="timestamp"><p>We wandered along the riverside road and then went into the night market area, passing blocks and blocks of stalls with tourist crafts. When the night market finally gave way, we were on Sisavangnong Road in an area with lots of restaurants and guest houses. Our ATM card had been rejected by three ATMs at this point, so we picked the Coconut Garden restaurant because it had a glossy menu in English and the host said they took credit cards. We tried to order as many Lao dishes as were vegetarian, including Mekong riverweeds, morning glory stir fry, eggplant and mushroom in banana leaves, and coconut pumpkin soup. The soup and the riverweeds were my favorites.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400639555" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-RJhK73ApZKY/Vib2HEvnoOI/AAAAAAAAa0s/J5UC2RZdr4Q/s288/P1470568.JPG" alt="20140521023235, "><span data-time="1400639555" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1400639555" class="timestamp"><p>On the walk home from the restaurant we finally found an ATM from which we could withdraw money (8,000 kips = $1) and we also discovered a short cut back to our hotel's side of the Nam Khan. There was a bamboo construction pedestrian bridge that was lighted by a string of Christmas lights which we could take from old town back to our side of the river. It was quite an experience to cross in the dark!</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400640200" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-0sD8SO-MSQM/ViKVCai-WDI/AAAAAAAAVko/i_UjrVIfxXc/s288/IMG_3683.JPG" alt="20140521024320, "><span data-time="1400640200" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1400640200" class="timestamp"><p>We learned today that the Thai military has put Bangkok under martial law, since there has been violence between pro and anti government protest groups. We are concerned about how this might affect our travels through Bangkok airport in the coming weeks.</p><p id="endOfEntry">&lt;End of Journal&gt;</p></span></span>

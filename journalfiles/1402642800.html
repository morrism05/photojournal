<h2><a id="Kyoto">Kyoto</a></h2><h3><a id="1402642800">06/13/2014</a></h3><p>Today was an early day as we needed to get to northern Kyoto for a morning tour. We rose around 6:30am, had our usual breakfast of eggs and yogurt, and got out of the room before 7:30am. We took the 5 bus almost to the end of its north-bound route, to just passed the Shugakuin rail station.</p><p>We walked to the gate of the Shugakuin Imperial Villa and twenty minutes before our tour the policeman at the gate let us in. Our passports were checked by reception to confirm our identity matched that the name on the reservation and we were given English audio guides.</p><p>The tour of the Shugakuin Imperial grounds. The ground consist of three parts. Built for retired Emperor Gomizuno'o in 1655 were the upper gardens and lower villa. Then, ten years later, a middle palace was built for Princess Akenomiya. The three areas of the ground are spread across a hillside of terraced rice fields, and look back to the south and west at the forested mountains beyond. To maintain the original scenic beauty of the location, the rice fields around the three villas/gardens were purchased by the Imperial Household in 1964 and are rented out to farmers for continued use.</p><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402675467" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-mftMwkcKmbU/Vky2WKeBj4I/AAAAAAAAfZE/e1qx4pbAysU/s288/P1500605.JPG" alt="20140613160427, "><span data-time="1402675467" class="timestamp"><p>Our tour started with the lower villa, Jugetsukan which was the used by the retired Emperor as a resting place. In the simple villa here, there are three raised tatami mats where is where the Emperor would sit. The gardens around Jugetsukan were pretty and contained ponds and azaleas, but we were quickly ushered through this area so I was not able to soak it in.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402676398" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-fx4JHdG43yg/Vky2WIIYIhI/AAAAAAAAfZA/Cul2IGy2lT8/s288/P1500623.JPG" alt="20140613161958, "><span data-time="1402676398" class="timestamp"><p>The middle villa, Rakushiken, built for Princess Akenomiya, had a larger and even more beautiful garden with stone bridges, ponds, a creek and many trees, azaleas and mossy ground cover. This was my favorite location on the tour. The villa building here is Kyakuden and it is known for having the most beautiful set of decorative shelves in all of Japan. They are supposed to resemble hanging mist.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402677302" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-qdlZoLgYhdI/Vky2WGEXqqI/AAAAAAAAfY4/jkzVcLPFqwA/s288/P1500650.JPG" alt="20140613163502, "><span data-time="1402677302" class="timestamp"><p>The upper villa was the largest enclosed area. It basically feels like a park set around a large pond. We entered the upper villa Okarikomi and followed a path to the tea house. The path is through high hedges so that you do not glimpse the view over the entirety of Okarikomi and out onto the borrowed landscape of the mountains and Kyoto until you have reached the tea house Rinuntei.</p><p>Looking over the garden landscape you see the pond Yokuryuchi below, with its island and covered bridge. The shape of the island is supposed to look like a swimming dragon, but I had a hard time reconciling the shape with that of a dragon.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402678514" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-greGTTxpz2M/Vky2WEizOSI/AAAAAAAAfY4/6S2s5iwCx3A/s288/P1500661.JPG" alt="20140613165514, "><span data-time="1402678514" class="timestamp"><p>We walked the path around the pond, crossed the bridges to and from the island, and then circled back to the entrance of the Upper Villa. This more or less ended our tour of the Shugakuin Imperial Villa.</p><p>Hungry (as we always seem to be around 10:30 or 11 am), we decided to retrace the bus route in reverse to find a boulangerie we had spotted by a university. We walked south along Shirakawa Dori for quite some time (longer than we expected) and came to an unanticipated boulangerie where we tried a chocolate croissant. The flavor was good, but it was gone in four bites, so we continued our trek. We then stopped in a grocery store to find some cheese for the baguette we intended to buy at the boulangerie. We found a selection of individually wrapped cheese bites from a company called LactyLife. Seeing as we did not have a knife on us, we went with this cheese gift bag for our lunch.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402683048" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-bQakA9IFbvc/Vky2WHjf_VI/AAAAAAAAfYw/U9q-Hd8zwIg/s288/P1500688.JPG" alt="20140613181048, "><span data-time="1402683048" class="timestamp"><p>Eventually, just across the street from the Kyoto University of Art Design, we found the boulangerie we had spotted on the bus. Grandir had a fantastic selection of pastries and breads, from which we picked a chocolate coated croissant, a pear tart and half a baguette. The woman behind the register spoke some English but was not able to point us towards a park where we could eat our spoils.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402686028" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-riNRDfSfoSU/Vky2WAmfZEI/AAAAAAAAfYw/2A1xUbw-G4I/s288/P1500691.JPG" alt="20140613190028, "><span data-time="1402686028" class="timestamp"><p>We decided to board a bus to Kinkaku-ji and see what we might pass along the way in terms of picnic grounds. Not too long into our travels we crossed over the river and decided its grassy banks lined with bike trails and benches would be perfect for our lunch spot. We disembarked, found a bench, and had our chocolate croissant (which actually was a slight letdown in the quality of the chocolate) and our cheese and bread.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402688441" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ZWeup3IAtjU/Vky2WNdzu7I/AAAAAAAAfYw/Vu7x2WHnSUM/s288/P1500694.JPG" alt="20140613194041, "><span data-time="1402688441" class="timestamp"><p>After lunch we continued on the bus to Kinkaku-ji. Even though it was well into the afternoon, there was still plenty of traffic headed in to see the golden temple and its grounds. We entered among crowds of Japanese school kids and western tourists.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402688931" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-BzSQjfTQ4TU/Vky2WCe_baI/AAAAAAAAfYw/PrmZfNDK9r4/s288/P1500696.JPG" alt="20140613194851, "><span data-time="1402688931" class="timestamp"><p>Thankfully, it was not hard to get good views of the temple. I spent leisurely amounts of time at each good viewpoint onto the temple's pond-facing front. The clouds were moving in and out (and even dropping a short rain shower), and so I had to wait to see the temple lit by the sun. It is still quite a sight to behold!</p><p>I did accept one request from some Japanese middle school boys for a photograph with them, and I helped a few other tourists take their family photos.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402690219" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-sLqRx3aEDfc/Vky2WLuBPMI/AAAAAAAAfYo/ICkymWfbMCY/s288/P1500726.JPG" alt="20140613201019, "><span data-time="1402690219" class="timestamp"><p>After I felt I had soaked in the view sufficiently, we walked along the path behind the temple, spotting a blue heron and a school of gulping koi. We walked out through the gardens, but were disappointed to see that the moss at Kinkaku-ji is struggling and that the bare dirt is showing in many places.</p><p>Katrina has been feeling tired and drained today, so we took the express bus back to Gojo Dori and returned to the hotel. She slept while I used the internet. Then around 5pm, I warmed up leftovers from yesterday's curry as an pre-diner. We also ate the pear tart (which was pretty good).</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402711498" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-bwxk90o6SpI/Vky2WKRXRAI/AAAAAAAAfYo/VhKorKr6NT0/s288/IMG_20140613_190458.jpg" alt="20140614020458, "><span data-time="1402711498" class="timestamp"><p>We decided we should take our last night in Kyoto to hunt down the grilled eggplant with miso (Nasu Dengaku 茄子田楽) which we had enjoyed so much in our prior trip to Japan and which we have tried to replicate in our home cooking. This dish is a Kyoto izukaiya specialty, so we should be able to find it here if we could find it anywhere. Katrina searched the web in English to find Kyoto restaurant which might have the dish. I found an English recipe with the Japanese characters for the dish (茄子田楽) and then searched Google maps for the Japanese term. Armed with a few likely local restaurants cached on our phones, we headed out to find our meal.</p><p>My restaurants were up around Shijo subway station. As we walked around the block to the back alley were the first restaurant (www.kyoto-rokkon.jp) is located, we looked at the menus of other local restaurants. We did in fact pass one other restaurant which was advertising via pictures an eggplant prepared with two-tone sauce. We presumed this was the nasu dengaku, but since the eggplant did not appear to be grilled, we held this place as a backup.</p><p>We did find Rokkon in the depths of a little ally and were excited to see that its interior matched that shown on Google. We walked in the door to the small establishment; six of the eight available seats were taken at the bar. When the chef/waiter saw us he held up his hands in a big X to indicate that we were not welcome. I don't know why we were not to come, but I'll presume for charitable sakes that he had reservations for the two remaining seats, and not that he just did not want to serve to English speaking guests.</p><p>We tried a second restaurant from my Google results and they even had an English menu. From the menu we quickly realized that the restaurant served Chinese food, so they would not serve nasu dengaku.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402714157" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XBFr4JFwRcg/Vky2WP8Ps8I/AAAAAAAAfYo/YuywlubtxFc/s288/P1500741.JPG" alt="20140614024917, "><span data-time="1402714157" class="timestamp"><p>I was feeling defeated at this point but Katrina suggested we try a sake brewery restaurant Moromine that she had found in her results. She had actually tried to book a sake tour with this company, but they had been full. When we entered the restaurant we showed the waitress a picture of nasu dengaku on my phone to confirm they had the goods. She confirmed in English that it was on the menu but then hesitated as to if they had seating space for us. Not so long after, she returned and seated us at a table in the upstairs dining area. We were the only tourists among five tables of Japanese business men and women who were grilling fish and vegetables on small grills set on the tables. The air was filled with the smoke of charred fish.</p><p>Our waitress helped us pick out a sake and took our double order of nasu. The dish arrived just as we had hoped. The grilled eggplant was juicy and refreshing, the miso sauces (one light and one dark) were salty, sweet and savory. We jabbed at the eggplant with our chopsticks for a few minutes before desert forks and spoons were brought unrequested to our table. The forks and spoons did get used.</p><p>We were very happy to have completed our nasu mission before leaving Japan. In a mix of mock and real joy, we did a jumping high-five after leaving the restaurant.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402717369" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-So6KHFzv0IU/Vky2WFhNbVI/AAAAAAAAfYk/gZsXkVLqGzE/s288/P1500746.JPG" alt="20140614034249, "><span data-time="1402717369" class="timestamp"><p>I was still thinking of food when we left Moromine, so we stopped in an Italian restaurant Quatro (sic) for a pizza. We were surprised to be sat a table underneath a poster of a naked woman's posterior. I think US Supreme Court justices would have recognized this poster as pornography if they had seen it. All of the other art in the restaurant was tastefully though, so I don't know how this poster slipped in! Katrina had me sit with my back to the poster as I ate my margarita pizza, but it resulted in her being distracted during my third dinner.</p><p>We returned back to the Citadines hotel at this point and got ready for dinner. I am not sure it has really sunk in that we are ending the sabbatical tomorrow and it is back to the USA and work!</p><p id="endOfEntry">&lt;End of Journal&gt;</p></span>

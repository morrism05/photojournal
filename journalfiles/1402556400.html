<h2><a id="Kyoto">Kyoto</a></h2><h3><a id="1402556400">06/12/2014</a></h3><p>Exhausted from our prior early rises, we had a slow morning today. We stayed in bed until after 8am. Then we ate breakfast, wrote in our journals for an hour and got ready for the day. It was 10am before we left the hotel.</p><p>We took the Keihan Rail Line south two stops to get to the Tofuku-ji temple complex. It was a short walk from the station to the temples themselves through very leafy neighborhoods with walled houses.</p><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402597025" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Gw-lFcb1M64/Vky2WNYPwGI/AAAAAAAAfZo/vt2ccllqBbg/s288/P1500477.JPG" alt="20140612181705, "><span data-time="1402597025" class="timestamp"><p>The Tofuku-ji temple complex is very large, and is spread over four square blocks or so. We came here because the complex is supposed to have many gardens within its grounds at different sub-temples.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402598061" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-YbQlRIJKsGM/Vky2WE_4DQI/AAAAAAAAfV0/hozGS5Rjb2Y/s288/IMG_5118.JPG" alt="20140612183421, "><span data-time="1402598061" class="timestamp"><p>We started with the Hojo building and its gardens. In fact, the four gardens on this site are relatively new and were designed in 1939. The largest garden is called the Southern Garden, and it has a large sea of raked gravel with four clusters of tall boulders and rolling mossy hills off in one corner. I was perhaps most interested in the way the gravel was raked in the Southern Garden. Typically we only see circle shapes raked into the gravel around boulder islands. In the Southern Garden however the linear pin striping across the sea would be interrupted by spiraling circles even where no boulder island was placed.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402598689" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-sIsajjgnVC4/Vky2WCRUXPI/AAAAAAAAfV0/YmN6MHp3EUg/s288/283-IMG_5133.JPG" alt="20140612184449, "><span data-time="1402598689" class="timestamp"><p>The Northern Garden was also very interesting. It has a checkerboard pattern of square stones breaking up a lawn of moss. The pattern is a perfect one-to-one alternation of stone and moss on the west end of the lawn, but fades into all moss as you look to the east. Behind the garden is the river gorge that splits the temple complex property.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402599030" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-PJFtyR2Uyvo/Vky2WKaYeUI/AAAAAAAAfV0/WsT_BNyYqAw/s288/IMG_5144.JPG" alt="20140612185030, "><span data-time="1402599030" class="timestamp"><p>After sitting and observing the Southern Garden for some time, we left Hojo and asked after the Ryogin-ji garden. We were told it was closed.</p><p>Foiled and ready for lunch, we left the Tofuku-ji temple complex and walked along the road going south to the Fushimi Inari Taisha shrines. Along the way we were on the lookout for a boulangerie to buy some baguette for sandwiches, but we did not find one. We ended up getting our bread from a grocery story (which was playing American rap over the store speakers!).</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402602599" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-IOX4gn4B8y8/Vky2WGS0dPI/AAAAAAAAfZY/LZAAEnUA_AI/s288/P1500525.JPG" alt="20140612194959, "><span data-time="1402602599" class="timestamp"><p>At Fushimi Inari Taisha we found a quiet corner out of the way from the shrine traffic where we could make our cheese, avocado and tomato sandwiches. After eating we picked up all the pieces of avocado which had slipped put of the backs of our sandwiches in case we would be sullying a sacred place.</p><p>Fushimi Inari Taisha is a Shinto shrine to the rice God and therefore it is very sacred in Japan and also in a sake brewing neighborhood like Fushimi. The fox is considered a protector of the rice, and so many fix statues appear in this shrine area too.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402605832" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-wUUg3-2nIyQ/Vky2WJHSFOI/AAAAAAAAfZY/vhE_BdO-1hg/s288/P1500529.JPG" alt="20140612204352, "><span data-time="1402605832" class="timestamp"><p>We then walked around the mountain through the tunnels of bright orange/red torii gates. People can sponsor and erect their own torii gate for between 1 and 13 thousand dollars depending on the size of the gate. Thousands of families must have made this donation because there are miles of back to back torii gates. It was a fun environment to photograph, if you could find a clear shot without another tourist in your frame.</p><p>I walked from the base of the mountain all the way to its 233m peak; Katrina was not feeling well and she only made it 75% of the way. The hike up was probably 1.5 miles long, and there were more or less continuous tunnels of torii gates throughout the hike. There were also multiple shrines where people had put miniature gates with their names on them too. It was quite a nice and unusual hike!</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402618814" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-aUcI7ZKN_rs/Vky2WObEA9I/AAAAAAAAfZI/B5txsxTDwVE/s288/P1500578.JPG" alt="20140613002014, "><span data-time="1402618814" class="timestamp"><p>We returned to the neighborhood of our hotel, did a little grocery shopping for dinner supplies, then returned to the room to rest, write, and cook dinner. We used a can of green curry found yesterday at the international market to make a green curry soup with carrot, broccoli, onion, snow peas and bell pepper.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402625174" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-FefXRORDK9Q/Vky2WKg_gpI/AAAAAAAAfZI/Eaj5EkNx04o/s288/P1500581.JPG" alt="20140613020614, "><span data-time="1402625174" class="timestamp"><p>At about 6:30pm we headed back for the trains to Fushimi neighborhood to have a tour of the Yamamoto Honke sake brewery. The tour was lead by Reina, the wife of Kogi, heir to the sake company. The company is one of the four original sake companies in Kyoto, and one of the few to make it through WWII when rice was rationed and sake brewing temporarily ceased. Yamamoto Honke has been making sake since 1677, and the ownership of the company gets passed to the first son. (Reina seemed a little nervous about this starting a family and trying for a son!) Sake companies have liked this neighborhood of Kyoto as it has very good water with low magnesium, resulting in less acidity in the sake.</p><p>Reina came from a sake brewing family herself, and her father had worked for the Japanese national brand. He actually worked for a few years in Folsom, CA at the sake factory there, and during that time Reina did high school in the USA. Reina's English is flawless and her accent is definitely American.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402626495" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-FIS-pluGdXk/Vky2WLfUV-I/AAAAAAAAfZI/oqk1oC5qq5w/s288/P1500586.JPG" alt="20140613022815, "><span data-time="1402626495" class="timestamp"><p>Reina took us into the brewery and showed us most of the steps of the process. Seeing as the sake is only brewed in the cold months, the factory is idle right now. We first walked passed the labeling plant where Reina says they employ grandmothers to put the labels on the bottles. We were shown where the rice is loaded into the factory. We could not see where the rice grains are polished to just leave the starch inside, but we heard that anywhere from 30% to 50% of the rice grain may be removed in polishing. Then comes a washing stage followed by the soaking and steaming of the rice. The cooked rice is then sprinkled with koji to convert the starch into sugar, and mixed the sake starter mash "shubo" and then let ferment for about 30 days. The sake is then pressed to remove any rice particles and run through charcoal to remove any discoloring. It is also pasteurized to prevent the flavor from changing in the bottle.</p><p>Most of the factory work is done with the aid of machines, but it still requires the 24 hour attention of sake brew masters to make sure the right flavors are created. A team of brew masters are at the factory 24 hours a day for 6 months!</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402629056" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-QXNK4S9RrP0/Vky2WEFdfgI/AAAAAAAAfZI/jWgZNgjjP3M/s288/P1500592.JPG" alt="20140613031056, "><span data-time="1402629056" class="timestamp"><p>We then were able to taste six sakes, some which were made without any added alcohol and some which did have alcohol added in the fermenting vat. Those without added alcohol had rounder flavors to them. Those with the added alcohol are said to have a clearer and sharper flavor, without losing any complexity. Reina said these are better to be had with food, as they do not compete with the food flavors as much.</p><p>We liked the second (a all rice, Junmai Ginjo), the fifth (an added alcohol and the final samples the best. The final sample was actually of a lemon flavored sake which was very refreshing to drink.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402630076" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-bC7Tys4TMX8/Vky2WOg-XNI/AAAAAAAAfZE/pPvLt_NQ9tU/s288/P1500604.JPG" alt="20140613032756, "><span data-time="1402630076" class="timestamp"><p>We brought home the Junmai Ginjo and the lemon Junmai.</p><p id="endOfEntry">&lt;End of Journal&gt;</p></span>

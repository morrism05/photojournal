Everything was covered in an in or so of new fresh snow. The sky was thick with clouds, but not currently snowing. Yesterday we had decided that if the day was clear we would further explore the Alps. It clearly was not clear, so we were heading to Stuttgart today to visit the Mercedes factory.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363357488" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-tf0Yk1iEDNs/VhgmPHXc7JI/AAAAAAAAI34/lai6bl4xj40/s288/P1410491.JPG" alt="20130315142448, "><span data-time="1363357488" class="timestamp"><p>We ate the Hotel Fantasia breakfast, which was actually a very generous and tasty spread of cold cuts, baked goods, fruit, muesli and yogurt. Then we cleared the snow off the car and hit the autobahn.</p><p>Half an hour north of Fussen it started snowing again. The snow gradually built up on the autobahn tarmac, to the point where I only had two narrow tracks of clear pavement for my tires. Then, as we approached Ulm, the storm diminished and the roads cleared again.</p><p>As we passed Ulm, we were able to spot the city's Dom. This cathedral boasts Europe's tallest church spire. There is only one spire on the church, and it is quite a massive one!</p><p>Katrina phoned the Mercedes museum from the road to see where their factory tours were held. They told us that the tours lead from the museum in Stuttgart, so we headed directly there.</p><p>The Mercedes complex is one of many industrial complexes strung along the narrow Neckar river valley. Mercedes does both manufacturing and design at this location, and has dozens of buildings. The museum building is a grand, tessellated 8 story structure which is much larger than the Audi museum but shares its design of starting the tour at the top and then spiraling down to the bottom.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363369867" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_xSZG1cvqNE/VhgmU90VgMI/AAAAAAAAI4w/PeXfEfpkG8Q/s288/P1410498.JPG" alt="20130315175107, "><span data-time="1363369867" class="timestamp"><p>The first exhibits in the museum are of the world's first car (a Mercedes) and its engine. This engine was compact and designed to operate at high speeds. Mercedes then looked for many modes of transportation into which it could install internal combustion engines, including rail cars, boats, blimp control modules, trucks and buses.</p><p>Each floor of the museum was dedicated to a different era in Mercedes and world history. I found the cars from the 1920's interesting as they pioneered the streamlined shapes which continue to be used in car design today. I also enjoyed the floor with the original Mercedes S-Class sedan, which I feel defines the Mercedes brand worldwide. The final floor had a large sweeping exhibit of Mercedes's racing cars, which was also exciting to see.</p><p>As we traveled between floors, displays talked about the world history occurring in the next era. It was particularly interesting to see how the displays referred to the history around WWII, where they used strong and clear language condemning Germany's actions during that era and also making it clear that MB did produce military machinery and even used forced labor from the prison camps in its factories.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363379246" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-4FF5G-ViDgk/VhgmrOlQSgI/AAAAAAAAI70/X2RAwlm2R28/s288/P1410524.JPG" alt="20130315202726, "><span data-time="1363379246" class="timestamp"><p>At 11:45am we started our factory tour, led by Henrick, a retired MB factory executive. The tour was of the engine plant Bad Cannstatt where Mercedes produces many of its 6 and 8 cylinder engines. We saw how they machine the forged aluminum engine blocks to ready them for production (they were making batch of 6 cylinder engines today), then we toured the production line where a mixture of robotic and manned stations assembled the engine from its varied components. The most interesting part of the assembly light is that various portions of the line were physically disconnected from each other and virtually connected by autonomous yellow robotic carts which ferried materials around the factory floor. These carts beeped as they went around their predefined paths and reminded me of R2D2. The manufacturing line use a supermarket style stocking system where lines of identical parks were put on titles racks so that as a part was used an identical part would back fill.</p><p>Also impressive to me was the sure size and girth of the V8 engines made at this plant. When fully assembled, with twin turbos and all, these were huge chunks of metal and wires!</p><p>Henrick was very interested in telling us about the "teamwork" system used in the factory, where teams make their own decisions and train new members, and management only has an assisting role in the daily workflow. This sounded a bit like the SCRUM process my work is implementing. We also learn about how if the workers come up with an idea to improve the factory, they get 30% of the savings to the company for the first year of implementation of that system. New workers at this factory make 2800 Euro a month.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363380247" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-bU99qamfOzY/Vhgmr6hiqEI/AAAAAAAAI8A/PolpAJLYBAc/s288/P1410526.JPG" alt="20130315204407, "><span data-time="1363380247" class="timestamp"><p>After the factory tour we ate a snack in the cafeteria (not as good as at Audi). At an adjacent table a middle aged woman was telling her dining compatriots about how the East Germans were a personal burden on her paycheck. It seems that when the Berlin Wall fell, the government started talking Solidarity Payments out of West Germans's paychecks to help bring East Germany up to speed. West Germans were told these payments might last 5 years, but they are still being taken out today and East Germany is still behind today. The lady went on to say that all the young East Germans come to West Germany anyway, and then have to be supported by the state (not sure why). She was clearly peeved about all those annoying East Germans who weren't taking care of themselves! (I wonder what she thinks of the Greeks, Italians and Spanish!)</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363387470" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-qZ-9Oh7NXC0/Vhgms2WjsjI/AAAAAAAAI8E/SVxSyLFqop4/s288/P1410528.JPG" alt="20130315224430, "><span data-time="1363387470" class="timestamp"><p>We went on to Heidelberg. We walked through the city center along its pedestrian avenue, took in the historic bridge, castle on the hill, and church, and peered in the restaurants. Heidelberg is very busy and bustling, and as a university town it has many interesting restaurants which seemed friendly to vegetarians. We tried a Japanese restaurant (Mosch Mosch) and scarfed down ramen and a wonderful salad. In Heidelberg we also purchased some local wine and got some more cash.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363398051" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-k7OtWAZPlCw/Vhgm97wllSI/AAAAAAAAI-U/NQpYT4fU4Do/s288/P1410553.JPG" alt="20130316014051, "><span data-time="1363398051" class="timestamp"><p>We drove along the Neckar river towards our hotel Castle Hornberg. All along the route are ruins of castles. Katrina was so excited to see each new castle in the fading light. We finally reached Hornberg, which is on a hillside over the Neckar, surrounded by terraced vineyards. It is rather impressive, partially reconstructed with many turrets and a drive through gate.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363398672" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-RurkV2ysStI/VhgnDi4KogI/AAAAAAAAI_Q/LhkrWgH6pwQ/s288/P1410565.JPG" alt="20130316015112, "><span data-time="1363398672" class="timestamp"><p>We were shown to our room #26 with its river view. From our windows we can see 2 other castles, and also watch the barge traffic go up and down the river and use the locks. Our room has high ceilings with exposed wood beams, and antique looking lighting. It is a small but comfortable place.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363399964" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-NIsPKxDlXv8/VhgnH0_ya5I/AAAAAAAAI_8/YGmX18Viu5Q/s288/P1410576.JPG" alt="20130316021244, "><span data-time="1363399964" class="timestamp"><p>We tried our local wine. When paired with the oranges we bought today it actually has some of the spice-flavors of our favorite Marzen beer from Bamberg.</p><p>We retired early to the comfortable bed.</p><p id="endOfEntry">&lt;End of Journal&gt;</p></span>

<h2><a id="SFO to Hong Kong">SFO to Hong Kong</a></h2><h3><a id="1398754800">04/29/2014</a></h3><p>Preamble - March 20, 2014<br>San Francisco</p><p>Katrina and I have been planning our second Autodesk sabbatical. Our plans are to visit Honk Kong, Nepal (Annapurna region), Chang Mai Thailand, Luang Prabang Laos, Siem Rep Cambodia, Ko Samui Thailand, Osaka Japan, the Kumano Kodo Trail, Osaka, Kanasawa, and Kyoto. We will be gone for a little more than 6 weeks. We are scheduling our trip around our move away from San Francisco to our new home-for-med-school in either Los Angeles. Our trip is inspired by our last sabbatical to Japan, China and Vietnam four and a half years ago. We hope to explore some exotic locations which we might not venture to with young children; child rearing is something we are considering for the near future.</p><p>This long trip between moves will begin on April 30th, 2014 and will end on June 14th.</p><p>April 29 and 30<br>SFO to Hong Kong</p><p>After a day at work, some last minute travel shopping and planning, and a nice evening dinner with the Kerman/Morris family, Katrina and I headed out of Grandma Janet's SF house with our packed bags for SFO. We drove our car to Thomas's shop, where we dropped it off to be under his care. Then we took an UberX to the airport.</p><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1398836853" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-K9rdxA8v81k/ViGp819mxHI/AAAAAAAAMyo/ubqJ8uatvkg/s288/P1450359.JPG" alt="20140430054733, "><span data-time="1398836853" class="timestamp"><p>Our flight was Cathay Pacific flight 873 nonstop to Hong Kong departing at 1am. I had never flown Cathay Pacific before, and they do things a little different. For starters, when you are checking in each agent comes and fetches you out of line and brings you to the desk. This makes you feel like you are more important than them (since they come to you). Our bags weighed in at 7.8 and 9.8 kilos, mine being lighter. Even though we had back of the plane economy seats, they still reclined very far, were a bit wider than normal, and were somewhat conducive of sleep. A very nice entertainment system was in each seat and the food service was tasty too. This Cathay 777 was the nicest economy experience I've ever had.</p><p>Our flight had headwinds, so it took about 14h 40m to get to HK. For 12 hours of the flight we were in darkness as we were running away from the sunrise. I tried to sleep as much as possible, and maybe got 5 or 6 hours of actual sleep and a similar amount of time with my eyes closed. Katrina slept less and watched many movies on her in-seat entertainment center. (I did watch American Hustle and Gravity.)</p><p>The main trouble on our flight was that a few hours in Katrina lost one of her ortho-K contact lenses. We spent some time searching the seats and floor but we were not able to find the lens.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1398890699" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-tQ9pAuFe3fA/ViGp87qcW3I/AAAAAAAAMys/efolQWWEuEY/s288/P1450373.JPG" alt="20140430204459, "><span data-time="1398890699" class="timestamp"><p id="endOfEntry">&lt;End of Journal&gt;</p></span>

<h2><a id="Kyoto">Kyoto</a></h2><h3><a id="1402470000">06/11/2014</a></h3><p>We got up early again this morning, with the goal of being at Ginkaku-ji at opening time so that we could enjoy the temple without crowds. We ate eggs and yogurt in the hotel room, and then got on the bus at about 8am.</p><p>We arrived at Ginkaku-ji just before 9am, which actually was later than the 8:30am opening. (I had mixed up the schedules.) We actually arrived along with many groups of school children, coming in from all over the country to learn Japanese history.</p><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402501741" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-YZruSnD70IU/Vky2WBn2RNI/AAAAAAAAfaY/xz1iNBzc5Ys/s288/P1500314.JPG" alt="20140611154901, "><span data-time="1402501741" class="timestamp"><p>We had been to Ginkaku-ji before on our last visit to Japan, but at that time the highlight temple was under renovation. Today, there was no scaffolding around the Silver Temple, and so we got full views. The Silver Temple is called such because the original plan was to cover it in silver as a counterpart to Kinkaku-ji, the Golden Temple. The silver cladding was never added though.</p><p>Ginkaku-ji's other signature elements are a raised rock garden with a chest high conical gravel pile, and a meandering garden pathway which tours you past all of the ponds and moss covered forests in the garden space.</p><p>Initially, I spent quite a bit of time trying to get a picture of the Silver Temple with the gravel garden in the foreground, but groups of school children were continually entering the garden blocking my shot. I then focused on one of the ponds in front of a secondary temple. Around this pond were many vibrant azaleas which brightened the view.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402503216" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_rYIa6bnUR0/Vky2WLvpSAI/AAAAAAAAfV0/3Hgpu8BrGa4/s288/IMG_5038.JPG" alt="20140611161336, "><span data-time="1402503216" class="timestamp"><p>As we walked the path around the gardens, five or so groups of school children approached us excitedly to ask if they could interview us. They all seemed to be middle schoolers, most from schools around Tokyo, and many were using the same worksheet to ask us questions. The questions were, what is your name, where are you from, what do you like in Kyoto, do you like Japan and the Japanese, can you please write us a message. It was fun and even mood-brightening to talk with these students. We took pictures with several groups.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402503470" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-I4shsHG1im4/Vky2WK0XtyI/AAAAAAAAfV0/kNbpimBdbOg/s288/IMG_5043.JPG" alt="20140611161750, "><span data-time="1402503470" class="timestamp"><p>Part of the garden path then winds through moss forest along the hillside. This was some of my favorite landscape four years ago. It is still very beautiful, but I think that the moss gardens of Gio-ji has topped it for me.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402505096" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-E5eu2gUI--E/Vky2WEjcn6I/AAAAAAAAfV0/UfmJUYJiwd4/s288/IMG_5055.JPG" alt="20140611164456, "><span data-time="1402505096" class="timestamp"><p>After completing our circuit around the garden and looking at Ginkaku-ji from other viewpoints across the pond, I went back to the first view of Ginkaku-ji behind the rock garden and waited for a clear shot at the temple. In not too long I had a few minutes where the view was free of tourists, and I got my shot.</p><p>I think what we are learning is that the temples are actually most busy at opening time, and that in the midday and afternoon they are less frequented.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402507733" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-67YXqSo8hYA/Vky2WNa17nI/AAAAAAAAfV0/8UQBVxUF4uQ/s288/IMG_5058.JPG" alt="20140611172853, "><span data-time="1402507733" class="timestamp"><p>We left and walked south along the canals towards Nanzen-ji. I recognized many of the neighborhoods along the way; we had walked this path before. When we came to Nanzen-ji it was about 11am and we were hungry for lunch. Katrina had read that there were tofu restaurants just west of Nanzen-ji with vegetarian menus, and so we looked for a particular one. We ended up finding the restaurant, but the meal prices started at $25/person and we did not want to pay so much!</p><p>Dipping back into the list of restaurants Katrina had researched, we decided to take a subway into central Kyoto to see if we could find a vegetarian buffet with home-style cooking. We exited the subway at Karasumaoike station and walked west on Okie Dori to Koromonodana St and turned right to walk one block north. The restaurant was completely closed, or, more specifically, the building that the restaurant was supposed to be in was vacant. This was not unexpected, as we have not had luck finding vegetarian restaurants in Japan at all!</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402513250" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Tv-8-Qfcy64/Vky2WHi00yI/AAAAAAAAfaA/so--g3ZxfRM/s288/P1500396.JPG" alt="20140611190050, "><span data-time="1402513250" class="timestamp"><p>We got a delicious almond croissant from a French bakery Le Petit Mec Oike on the same block, then walked to the opposite side of Okei Dori to see if a Mexican restaurant found on Google existed. There was a placard with menu items for the alphabet, but it was not open either. We walked back to Karasumaoike station and along the way passed an udon and tempura restaurant with a line (of office workers) out the door.</p><p>The restaurant was cafeteria style where you selected what kind of noodles you wanted, put all the tempura pieces you wanted onto your tray, added in some pre-made salads, then paid by what you had ordered at the register. Just after the register were stations for putting the broth into your noodles and mixing your seasoning sauces.</p><p>Katrina and I loaded up our plates with good looking tempura eggplant, asparagus, pumpkin, and yam, I got a bowl of the udon noodles (we could watch them making the noodles from scratch, rolling out the dough, cutting them, and boiling them to order) and Katrina got a cucumber salad and an eggplant salad. It was a delicious if heavy lunch.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402518271" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-M3vEpyGydv8/Vky2WNSwccI/AAAAAAAAfaA/Q6VnhGtBakY/s288/P1500403.JPG" alt="20140611202431, "><span data-time="1402518271" class="timestamp"><p>We returned by subway to Nanzen-ji temple. (Along the way I spotted a gray Nissan coupe parked in front of a classy residence in the exact same spot it had been 4 years ago!) After passing through its enormous Sanmon main gate, and peering inside a large temple with a dragon painting on the ceiling, we purchased tickets to enter the main pavilion of the temple.</p><p>Frankly, I was not awed by the main pavilion. There were a few rock gardens, the largest of which is the Hojo Garden which is a large sea of gravel with a moss and boulder island. The boulders are said to look like young tigers exiting a river. There were nice screens inside the temple rooms, but we could only peer at them through the doors, and could not take photos. We did sit for a little while and listen as two monks and two parishioners entered a temple room and participated in a chanting ceremony. A large bell was struck several times during the ten minute chant.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402521027" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-POoRsDSXqwY/Vky2WHQjkgI/AAAAAAAAfV0/elsacJz1yP4/s288/IMG_5083.JPG" alt="20140611211027, "><span data-time="1402521027" class="timestamp"><p>We looked at the still functioning aqueduct running through the Nanzen-ji property, then walked to the nearby Murin-an villa. This villa and garden was created at the end of the 19th century by the owner of the grounds, Aritomo Yamagata, who was a statesman. The gardens look like a mountain stream and meadow in a forest clearing. The garden uses "borrowed scenery," which is to say that mountains from outside of the villa grounds fill the horizon in such a way that they feel like that are part of the garden landscape. Murin-an feels like the ideal for what a mountain meadow should be, with its burbling streams, mossy ground cover, elegant trees, and curving paths. We sat in the garden for maybe an hour, enjoying the view from many points.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402536974" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-CL6pA2YCFiM/Vky2WNhwZ8I/AAAAAAAAfZs/77kvkaCKbGU/s288/P1500469.JPG" alt="20140612013614, "><span data-time="1402536974" class="timestamp"><p>It was threatening to rain when we left, and we were tired from our early start. We bused our way home with a short stop in central Kyoto to buy bread from a boulangerie and to visit and upscale international supermaket and purchase good cheese, chickpeas and other salad ingredients. The bread, cheese and salad would later become our dinner.</p><p>Back the hotel Kat napped while I watched videos, then we ate the aforementioned dinner. Around 8pm we headed out into the drizzle to do a walking tour of the geisha districts of Ponto-cho Dori and Gion. Ponto-Cho is a tight little street on the west side of the river which is packed with tea houses where geiko meet their clients, restaurants and bars. It actually feels very touristy, and most of the restaurants have English menus.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402543978" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-G_cbmlfoavw/Vky2WB1heeI/AAAAAAAAfV0/MfwXT4In3GA/s288/IMG_5117.JPG" alt="20140612033258, "><span data-time="1402543978" class="timestamp"><p>We then crossed the river, went passed the Kabuki theater, and walked in Gion. Again there were many restaurants and tea houses, but on this side it was less aimed at the tourists. Many more well dressed Japanese (and well heeled young ladies accompanying the middle aged men) were out on the street, making their way between the restaurants and clubs. On Shijo dori street around Hanamikoji dori street, we saw two geiko with red umbrellas crossing the street.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402546185" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-PwcHs31BE3k/Vky2WFnDkNI/AAAAAAAAfZs/g_ud5j6UzlE/s288/P1500476.JPG" alt="20140612040945, "><span data-time="1402546185" class="timestamp"><p>North of Shijo dori street near Shirakawa-minami dori and it's parallel canal where many multistory buildings advertising restaurants, love clubs and girl bars. I am not sure what a love club or girl bar is! However, here is the area where we saw the most well dressed men and (young) women out on the street.</p><p>We returned to the hotel by bus, and retired for the night.</p><p id="endOfEntry">&lt;End of Journal&gt;</p></span>

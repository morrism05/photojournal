I was not finished journaling when Katrina returned, so we went down to breakfast (our room is in the same rebuilding as the restaurant). The breakfast spread here is not actually as nice as the one at Hotel Fantasia, but it is still decent. We made cheese, cucumber, and tomato sandwiches, ate chocolate croissants, and had yogurt with muesli. In the dining room was a painting of the infamous knight Gotz von Berlichingen of the castle Hornberg, who's contribution to the German language was to coin the phrase "kiss my ass."</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363450471" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-VFUrQL7JP8Q/VhgndJie1zI/AAAAAAAAJDE/FYJzvTWYl0w/s288/P1410607.JPG" alt="20130316161431, "><span data-time="1363450471" class="timestamp"><p>After breakfast I finished my journaling and then we went to explore the castle ruins. The ruins are from the 1300's on, and the castle was progressively expanded over the centuries. Most of the construction occurred in the 1500's, including the building in which we stayed. We were able to walk within the (ceiling-less) walls of the old castle and climb its turrets. Only a few of the structures still retained their roofs. From the towers, the views out along the Neckar river were expansive, bright and sunny, if rather cold.</p><p>At around 10:45am we left the castle Hornberg and headed for the Pfaltz wine region on the west side of the Rhine river. Seeing as France was only 20 minutes out of the way, we set the GPS to Wissembourg to search out a good French baguette.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363461700" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-M-L5AbxSVr4/VhgofX2VICI/AAAAAAAAJMI/RHl317dCgh0/s288/P1410697.JPG" alt="20130316192140, "><span data-time="1363461700" class="timestamp"><p>Wissembourg did feel more French than I expected for being just on the border. We walked about the city center, checking out the boulangerie, pattiserie and fromagerie. The city is cut by two small canals, potentially making it the Venice of France (at least in our heads!). After walking about in this pleasant town, we got a lunch of salad and flammekuchen (flat bread with cheese) at Charles V.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363469120" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Q0txFYL3Z-0/VhgozZzB-2I/AAAAAAAAJOw/1mD9eBiQxsU/s288/P1410722.JPG" alt="20130316212520, "><span data-time="1363469120" class="timestamp"><p>We left France and drove north on the German Wine Road. This road squiggles along the foot of the mountains which form the western edge of the Rhine Valley. We squiggled from town to town, looking for a winery amongst the patchwork fields which offered wine tasting. Our California expectations had us looking for large, chateau-like buildings amongst the vines as wineries. Not seeing any location of this type we grew frustrated. I started forming the theory that the wineries had their tasting rooms in the little villages. We had been passing dozens of signs for "weingut", and in Eschbach I spotted a weingut "Wind" with a number of people outside. We parked, and went to question the people if wine tasting was available here. They pointed us to a door up a staircase.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363471529" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-q-rwbnSF3d0/Vhgo1HMgJwI/AAAAAAAAJPE/7Dex6CBWArY/s288/P1410724.JPG" alt="20130316220529, "><span data-time="1363471529" class="timestamp"><p>Tentatively, we opened the door. On the other side was a small room with two tables, two people at each table and a fifth person pouring wine. There were multiple bottles of wine on each table and also some bread, so my first impression was that this was a small restaurant. The server did not speak any English but the patrons did, and after we confirmed that we were in the right place for tasting the middle aged couple at the table closest to the door cleared a space at their table so we could join them.</p><p>Multiple bottles of white wine were brought out (the tasting menu had nearly 30 wines), and Katrina was poured "tastes" by the proprietress that were nearly half glasses of wine. We tried a number of their Rieslings, including classic and trucker (dry) varieties, and also gewurztraminer, gruner silvaner, and moscato wines. They were all very drinkable, if tending towards sweet, and all incredibly priced below 6 Euros per bottle!</p><p>We were also encouraged to try the bread and spread on the table. Only after dipping into the spread did we learn it was lard based.</p><p>The other patrons in the tasting room were wonderful, asked us questions about out trip, shared their own stories of cold visits to San Francisco in the summer (the couple from our table) and of visiting relatives in New Jersey (the lady at the other table), and were genuinely interested in seeing how we liked the local wines. Like them we did!</p><p>After Katrina's fourth half glass and many stories and laughter with the other patrons, we readied ourselves to leave. Then, out came the walnut liquor (Walnusselikor). This gorgeous brown liquor found a perfect balance of sweetness, nuttiness, and alcohol bite. After this final schluk, we purchased a bottle of Riesling Spatlese (Trocken) and thanked the patrons and proprietress and left.</p><p>We drove a bit further north along the Weinstrasse, then did a quick shop in an Aldi supermarket for fillings for our French baguette. With cucumber, tomato, and cheese in hand, we hit the autobahn for Nurburg.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363484014" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-6Tnxidj6PnU/VhgpC38kjFI/AAAAAAAAJQ8/pCEC6N4pMd8/s288/P1410740.JPG" alt="20130317013334, "><span data-time="1363484014" class="timestamp"><p>It was only an hour before the snow we left behind yesterday reappeared on the landscape. We climbed up into wooded mountains with increasingly steep terrain. After two hours, we pulled off the autobahn and completed the last 25km to Nurburg. I approached the 'Ring with anticipation and sadness, and the cover of snow meant that my Sunday Tourist day had been cancelled. With excitement I spotted my first few segments of the Nordschleife from the B421 road - most surprising to me is just how steep the track is. It looks like a veritable roller coaster. While the black track tarmac can be see, all runoff is completely covered in snow, and I imagine there are numerous patches of ice around the circuit which would make it unlappable.</p><p>We filled up at a gas station right next to the famous gantry which starts the circuit's longest straightaway. Driving into town we passed the numerous tech centers for the various automobile manufactures, and then entered the rather sparse neighborhood where our hotel Am Tiergarten is located.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363484658" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-40WGE4T7_G4/VhgpDhI51aI/AAAAAAAAJRE/CcJq9NpOxgc/s288/P1410743.JPG" alt="20130317014418, "><span data-time="1363484658" class="timestamp"><p>It appears we are the only guests at the hotel tonight; the parking lot is nearly empty. Our room is basic but clean. We made a dinner of baguette sandwiches and wine, finished with the wonderful raspberry tart we bought in Wissembourg. Using the laminated cards from the hotel, I took Katrina on a virtual tour of the Nordschleife. Then, with nothing else to do, we watched some TV and then went to bed.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363491645" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-m7ondB7tmTM/VhgpGfS_xAI/AAAAAAAAJRg/NfUWieN6qfo/s288/P1410748.JPG" alt="20130317034045, "><span data-time="1363491645" class="timestamp"><p id="endOfEntry">&lt;End of Journal&gt;</p></span>

It was a little more expensive at about $20 per person, but the quality of the food was very good. We even through their croissants met French standards. I made sure to add a salad to my breakfast, as the $10 salads from yesterday were still fresh in my mind.</p><p>Yesterday we had been looking at the express trains to Kanazawa and saw that they leave every 30 minutes (at a quarter after the hour and a quarter to) but that the quarter-to train was actually a bit faster to its destination. It looked like we might make the 9:42 train from Osaka station, so we donned our rain gear (it was drizzling), checked out of the hotel, and took the subway three stops north to Umeda/Osaka station.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402072509" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-5HLKbLP2o_I/Vky2wC5KlMI/AAAAAAAAfdg/6ueUffYn2f8/s288/P1490634.JPG" alt="20140606163509, "><span data-time="1402072509" class="timestamp"><p>We bought tickets at the manned ticket office (about $70 per person) and made it to the track in plenty of time. There were lines for the unreserved cars, however when the train arrived those cars were completely empty so finding a seat was not so hard. We sat on the north-east facing side of the train.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402075704" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-TliRf68nEno/Vky2wFX_5DI/AAAAAAAAfdg/4ptF8Jojns4/s288/P1490642.JPG" alt="20140606172824, "><span data-time="1402075704" class="timestamp"><p>Between Osaka and Kyoto was less than an hour and was all through urban landscape. Then the tracks ran along the west shore of Biwa Lake, a very large inland lake, where we saw mixes of rice farming and urban development. I noticed that there were more old style wood construction houses in this region.</p><p>After we left the lakeside we passed through a range of mountains, seeing multiple valleys with farming communities and thickly forested hillsides. I did not see much evidence of logging.</p><p>The train then came onto the plains along the Sea of Japan coast. The urban development and factories returned. On the horizon were Japan's tall mountains - we did get a glimpse of one range with snow.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402083252" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Mmz6FmWbtTE/Vky2wDZDUiI/AAAAAAAAfdc/GscnmHn5Kq0/s288/IMG_20140606_123411.jpg" alt="20140606193412, "><span data-time="1402083252" class="timestamp"><p>We pulled into Kanazawa at about 12:15pm. In the train station we got maps and schedules for the weekend's festivities. There is a city wide festival occurring while we are here. Our hotel, the Dormy Inn, is just outside of the station on its east side. We dropped off our bags since it was too early to check in and then started exploring.</p><p>Our first step was to try and find Kanazawa's vegan restaurant Earth Cafe. (So much for overeating at breakfast so as to delay lunch!) Lonely Planet and HappyCow.com had directions to it, about ten minutes away from the station's west exit. We walked to its location via a very broad, tree lined, avenue and learned from a security guard that the cafe had gone out of business.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402089217" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-DJFDNxOk24Q/Vky2wPpEt4I/AAAAAAAAfV8/4zdxQIjUMiQ/s288/IMG_4516.JPG" alt="20140606211337, "><span data-time="1402089217" class="timestamp"><p>We then decided to get on the tourist bus which loops around central Kanazawa to see if we could find a row of restaurants from which we could pick a lunch spot. We took the bus to the intersection of the Asanogawa River and Hikoso Ohdohn Ave, but did not find a vast selection of restaurants as we had hoped. We walked south along the river for a couple of bridges, passing some very cute riverside houses and businesses (closed at this hour). At Hashiba we gave up on finding a restaurant along the river and got back on the tourist bus to find a more touristy area.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402090411" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-c3W-4V8wGfk/Vky2wDrzy2I/AAAAAAAAfdc/OyNseheYpWo/s288/P1490656.JPG" alt="20140606213331, "><span data-time="1402090411" class="timestamp"><p>We took the bus to the west side of Kenrokuen Garden, where we found a street full of gift shops and snack vendors. Katrina and I both had our first rice cakes of this visit to Japan; they were served warm. We also found an udon noodle restaurant which was just shy of closing its lunch service (it was 2:45pm), and we stopped and ordered noodles. Katrina's dish with udon in broth and a gigantic piece of tofu was better than my brothless udon with egg.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402093255" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-uaUa7O151CM/Vky2wD3Ah1I/AAAAAAAAfV8/Ke2gIt5j7KM/s288/IMG_4519.JPG" alt="20140606222055, "><span data-time="1402093255" class="timestamp"><p>The Kenrokuen Gardens are free to visit during the weekend of the city festival, so we entered to do a little exploring while we were nearby. The garden is characterized by many broad pebble-covered pathways which wind through shady moss-covered forests. The highlights for me were the blooming azalea bushes and the views along Kasumigaike Pond. Also fun was the way the garden supported some pine trees like the Karasakinomatsu Pine in unnatural poses using bamboo pools to support branches which would otherwise snap. We watched some of the gardeners mowing the grass along the pond by hand; by "mowing" I mean they were ripping the grass by hand to the desired height.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402097881" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-pzxLh7eLm1A/Vky2wPUZpJI/AAAAAAAAfdQ/FTrZCoXUplU/s288/P1490686.JPG" alt="20140606233801, "><span data-time="1402097881" class="timestamp"><p>We left the gardens and caught the tourist bus (we were just in time!) and rode it back to the train station and our hotel. Katrina had a quick shower before we headed out again at 5:30pm to grab dinner before the lantern floating event on the Asanogawa River.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402102483" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SAiUemW4I2c/Vky2wPUmenI/AAAAAAAAfdQ/w50E8OrHKqo/s288/P1490687.JPG" alt="20140607005443, "><span data-time="1402102483" class="timestamp"><p>Katrina and I are no longer feeling like we need to eat every meal in a Japanese restaurant. I think the vegetarian options we know from Japanese cuisine (tempura, noodles, oniyamiaki) are feeling over eaten at this point. The Italian restaurant we wanted to visit was not responding to phone calls, so we ate at the closer Chianti restaurant on the commercial avenue near Ohmicho Market. Our "13 Greens" salad only appeared to have three greens, but at least the pizza was passable and the service was friendly. We are suckers for any place with an English menu too.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402105207" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-2cXZ1I4plVg/Vky2wBn_3_I/AAAAAAAAfdQ/NLGs3XH0c7Y/s288/P1490689.JPG" alt="20140607014007, "><span data-time="1402105207" class="timestamp"><p>After dinner we walked back to the Hashiba area of the Asanogawa River. We stood on a bridge waiting for the floating lantern festival to start, and were treated to a rainbow over the river. I was a little surprised as it was not raining where we were, but then a little while later the rain caught up with us. Thankfully it was light and did not stay to long.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402106602" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-rn1vSJRbgks/Vky2wImkcgI/AAAAAAAAfV8/9nhz6s0bVsk/s288/IMG_4550.JPG" alt="20140607020322, "><span data-time="1402106602" class="timestamp"><p>We were shooed from the bridge by the police, and so we crowded along the river walk wall looking out at the pavilion on the far side. After some speeches and music, the the first of the lit lanterns was put in the river. The lanterns were mostly cubes of about 2' wide, but the sized varied from one to another. We watched as lanterns were launched from the pavilion and sent downstream towards us and the bridge. The flow of lanterns was slow until a massive flow of lit lanterns from much further upstream came floated into view. From this point on there was a constant trail of lit boxes going down the river.</p><p>The river was quite low and so there were many assistants in waders standing in the river to free snagged lanterns and set them back into the main current. A few ladies near our bridge were having a difficult time keeping the lantern from collecting under the half of the bridge where the water was pooled instead of flowing.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402111249" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-TVlMKiTl988/Vky2wGXfhmI/AAAAAAAAfdA/npT4HsKiqjc/s288/P1490750.JPG" alt="20140607032049, "><span data-time="1402111249" class="timestamp"><p>We went and took in the view from the next pedestrian bridge up river, then walked down on the rocky river bank itself to see the lanterns float by up close. Seeing them close was a highlight, as each lantern was individually decorated with drawings and paintings. There were many lilies and carnations, a few coy and even a few trains. There were a few lanterns which looked like they had been painted by toddlers, but mostly the quality of art on the lanterns was quite high. It was beautiful to watch. We also were tickled by the non-rectangular lanterns and especially a large one shaped like the cartoon character Totoro.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402115745" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-67_A8ANGA_k/Vky2wCV1cAI/AAAAAAAAfcw/-HHpNpYEnEw/s288/P1490794.JPG" alt="20140607043545, "><span data-time="1402115745" class="timestamp"><p>After the last lantern floated by, we left the river and walked home to the hotel. Along the way we stopped and purchased some mochi balls from a street vendor. They turned out to be both sweet and slightly salty, and not completely in line with our tastes.</p><p>Back at the hotel I used the onsen, even at 10:30pm it was very busy with many Japanese guests. I did not interact with anyone.</p><p>We then went to sleep.</p><p id="endOfEntry">&lt;End of Journal&gt;</p></span>

The breakfast buffet here is by far the largest of any we have seen on this trip and has four long counters of food, with western, Indian, Japanese and Thai options. I had an omelet, fruit, yogurt, toast, banana bread and a croissant.</p><p>Back in the room we put our stuff together for our tour. I am sunburnt on shoulders and torso from yesterday so I dressed in long sleeves and long pants, with my swim suit underneath. I also put on plenty of sunscreen too.</p><p>We went to the front desk to wait for our pick up for the Ang Thong National Marine Park tour. The driver was already at our hotel when we arrived. The driver headed north and stopped at a few other hotels to get other tourists, so along the way we got to see parts of Ko Samui beyond Chaweng. It seems that much of the rest of the island and certainly the interior of the island has a local feeling, with lots of little stores and residences and green space in between. Still, the resorts we pulled into were just a big and glamorous as ours (actually, maybe more glamorous) but have elbow room around them and large sprawling grounds.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401290481" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-VhvmpQXkXFM/VkoZokj5s2I/AAAAAAAAfLs/ExeKR3qBSJk/s288/P1480512.JPG" alt="20140528152121, "><span data-time="1401290481" class="timestamp"><p>When we finally made it to our boat dock at Bo Phut we saw we were one of the last to arrive. There were many many guests sprawled around on benches and picnic tables. We signed it, got our snorkel gear and joined the sprawl. I saw three speed boats with their sterns just feet from the short and presumed that the crowd would be split between the boats. Yet, it was not to be. We all (maybe 30 people?) were loaded in the largest boat (capacity 45 passengers) and thankfully we still had some room to spare. Katrina and I sat in the back section under the sun awning and looked out the rear of the boat.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401295300" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-gthM66idBZY/VkoZonmEycI/AAAAAAAAfLs/3IUtKUFphbA/s288/P1480516.JPG" alt="20140528164140, "><span data-time="1401295300" class="timestamp"><p>It was a one hour trip across open water to get to a snorkeling spot. We snorkeled for 45 minutes in a small cove of a small island. Beneath the surface were plenty of varied corals, with different shapes and colors. Some big clams with wavy shells were embedded in the coral, as if the coral had grown around them. I touched one by accident and it drew in its big lips. We also saw many schools of fish, some with zebra stripes, some green with iridescent blues and purples. The zebra fish thought they could "do massage too" and nibbled me on the feet. The water was a little stirred but not too cloudy. It was also bathtub warm. Katrina saw a ray while I was on the boat using the head.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401298870" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-6jAqA6s8Dg0/VkoZogtEozI/AAAAAAAAfLk/x7ZzsIsOwh0/s288/P1480523.JPG" alt="20140528174110, "><span data-time="1401298870" class="timestamp"><p>Next the boat tour took us through the islands. I am not sure how many we passed, but it was probably about 25. These islands are uninhabited, and are said to be teaming with wildlife (not that we saw any animals). I thought the islands were similar to those from Cat Ba bay in Vietnam. They are largely karst limestone, and well weathered into fins and spines. The rock at the waterline is eroded from the waves and most over the islands have cave-like overhangs at the water level. There is some evidence of deeper caves and maybe tunnels too. The foliage on the islands is dense and green with trees and vines. Every so often a small white beach is visible.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401300314" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-oOAGZIBSKFM/VkoZopB85qI/AAAAAAAAfLk/Nc60ghAVTpQ/s288/P1480540.JPG" alt="20140528180514, "><span data-time="1401300314" class="timestamp"><p>We pulled into Mae Koh and looked at its internal lagoon. It was a short hike up steep steel and concrete stairs to get to the overlooks. One of the guides from the boat hiked up there too, and was offering to take photos for the tourists. The lagoon water is a blue-green color.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401303880" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-3P7gUeoi54Q/VkoZok1hdOI/AAAAAAAAfLM/cWMMAZw7tXw/s288/P1480559.JPG" alt="20140528190440, "><span data-time="1401303880" class="timestamp"><p>We then went by boat to a fishing village Phaluay to our lunch restaurant. Our vegetarian lunches were a bit plain, but then maybe the carnivores' lunch was too. We ate out on a deck with a covered roof, looking out on a canal on the edge of town. The houses here are very modest and have no cosmetic touches that I can tell. After lunch I walked for a few minutes in the village. I saw villagers in groups of four betting on a card game that used tongue-depressor sized cards. The only other notable thing about the village was all of the wind and solar power generators. There is no public utility on the island so residents generate their own power. While I walked around Katrina lay on a bench in the shade and tried to sleep.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401309741" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-GFZsAwftpuQ/VkoZoq4o-DI/AAAAAAAAfKo/v7AMkgQL2pE/s288/P1480577.JPG" alt="20140528204221, "><span data-time="1401309741" class="timestamp"><p>Back on the boat we sped past more islands to get to our kayaking point. We passed a balanced-rock island on the way which looked very tenuous from the front. But when we pulled away from the island and its side was revealed we saw that there is actually a long wall of support for the overhead mass.</p><p>For 45 minutes we kayaked along the shore of one island. We tried to stay in the sea cave overhang at the base of the island to stay in the shade. As we paddled we saw crabs scurrying into holes in the cliff face and tiny fish jumping from the water. Looked for langurs in the trees but did not see any.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401314729" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-KLi1AW9hpYE/VkoZoupNzUI/AAAAAAAAfKo/uxsjIUMKIiM/s288/P1480583.JPG" alt="20140528220529, "><span data-time="1401314729" class="timestamp"><p>We returned the kayak and sat in the water of the shallow bay, shaded by the roof of a rock overhang. Hanging from the roof of.the overhang was a basket with three large crabs in it, dinner for the park ranger and his sons. The sons tried to engage us in play but it ended in sand throwing. One of the sons had shockingly decayed teeth.</p><p>Boat took us back to Ko Samui. We passed along the whole north shore of Ko Samui from the Four Seasons resort to Bo Phut. This shore is all lined with resorts, but most had empty beaches. The boat stopped at three resorts to let off guests; the rest of us got off where we started at Bo Phut.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401325003" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-goYTJ_ZpXgc/VkoZol2_4ZI/AAAAAAAAfKc/oGfmsth51XY/s288/P1480591.JPG" alt="20140529005643, "><span data-time="1401325003" class="timestamp"><p>After we were dropped off by van back at the hotel, we showered, washed clothes, and then readied for dinner. We had dinner at Khow Glong again, getting a coconut icee, stir fried wide noodles, and green curry. The curry was spicier today than it was at yesterday's lunch.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401325318" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-9J7hPhH_kLk/VkoZotziESI/AAAAAAAAfKc/MfRu_x8nvy8/s288/P1480594.JPG" alt="20140529010158, "><span data-time="1401325318" class="timestamp"><p>Back at the hotel we attended happy hour. A glass of red Italian wine made Kat happy. A chocolate milkshake did it for me.</p><p>Returned to the room to watch The Beach, a Leonardo DiCaprio movie from the late 1990s that is set in Ang Thong Park. We also wrote in our journals.</p><p id="endOfEntry">&lt;End of Journal&gt;</p></span>

We took the autobahn south to Inglostadt. Traffic was pretty light and south of Nuremburg we hit 237kph on a downhill stretch. (BMW claims a 233kph top speed for this model.) The 320d is pretty slow to accelerate over 210kph. It really does feel like you are going fast going at top speed! Definitely the fastest I have been in a car. I am finding the car to be very comfortable and stable, but a bit uncommunicative through the wheel, and long and slightly balky through the shifter. The car's navigation system and HUD are highlights though.</p><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363022438" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-zxrKD_jXp0M/Vhge549ixpI/AAAAAAAAH3E/mqUZsuj57G0/s288/P1400783.JPG" alt="20130311172038, "><span data-time="1363022438" class="timestamp"><p>Arrived at the Audi Forum at 10:30am. I checked out the cars parked in the plaza, particularly the Lamborghini Gallardo and Aventador, plus a matte blue Audi R8. I has my first time seeing the current RS4 wagon too - I like it but thought the wheels looked oversized. We grabbed a snack in the cafeteria, and then quickly visited the museum. I liked seeing the old silver arrow race cars, the original rally Quattro race car, and the new Le Mans hybrid racer.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363026010" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-k9WMboH2sPY/VhgfaHoY1zI/AAAAAAAAH7s/N_H591ACRfQ/s288/P1400823.JPG" alt="20130311182010, "><span data-time="1363026010" class="timestamp"><p>We were preregistered for the factory production tour, which left at 11:30. The plant makes A3, A4, A5, Q5 cars. We first visited the assembly line where the stamped steel pieces are welded and glued together to form the body of the car. Then we visited the final assembly line where the body is married to the chassis and engine and the interior is installed. All of the building of the body is done by robots. On the same line we saw A4s and A5s being constructed, also some Q5s. It was Audi A3s in final assembly being constructed by human workers largely. The plant had a particular smell to it - which we think came from the welding - that I found a bit off putting. Combined with the constant movement all about, I left a bit dizzy. I found the seam welding interesting, where a thin copper wire is placed between two sheets of metal and a robot welds/melts it between the steel pieces to be joined. I also enjoyed checking out all of the manned stations, each with a task to be completed in 87 seconds. There are about 150 stations total in the final production process. It was very nice to be allowed so close to the assembly action!</p><p>The assembly hall was 2km long, there were bike stations spread about so workers could get from one side to the other. Blue collar workers were in uniform; supervisors where suspenders. White collar workers were in suites. Also every .5km or so was a food market to supply the lunches for the production line workers. In their 8 hour shift they get two 15min pee breaks and a 30 minute lunch. The workers were middle aged and younger. 20% of the workforce are women.</p><p>Then we went and got a nice salad at the cafeteria, and planned our next stop.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363042738" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-EqWe3W0p3lM/Vhgfci7he5I/AAAAAAAAH8I/E4161VjrHnM/s288/P1400827.JPG" alt="20130311225858, "><span data-time="1363042738" class="timestamp"><p>We visited Regensburg, which was to the east and north. We took secondary roads, which were full of slow trucks, past farms and small villages. Once at Regensburg, we explored the old city heart with its many cobblestone alleys. Most impressive there was the city's Gothic Dom and its very colorful stained glass. The rest of the cathedral was actually pretty staid, but the backlit windows were something to behold. Katrina was taken by the soaring columns and glass. The size and scale of such a cathedral is incredible, especially when you consider how long ago it was built.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363045349" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-OlzShDAZMZ4/ViF5LTdSRNI/AAAAAAAAKyI/HsgWNZ14drw/s288/IMG_8842.JPG" alt="20130311234229, "><span data-time="1363045349" class="timestamp"><p>We also visited the oldest standing bridge on the Danube, from the 1100's. It is actually quite a big bridge, probably 2 lanes wide. Now it is pedestrian only.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363047095" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-08xu2XTdPEM/Vhgfz0cBghI/AAAAAAAAH_M/xcIZrfySxOw/s288/P1400866.JPG" alt="20130312001135, "><span data-time="1363047095" class="timestamp"><p>We grabbed some treats at the oldest coffee house in Germany (1686). I enjoyed the apfelstrudel, our first of the trip.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363054626" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-x7GCZZIZ-uQ/ViFjQbGosFI/AAAAAAAAKOQ/xC_F8mrPbjk/s288/IMG_20130311_141705.jpg" alt="20130312021706, "><span data-time="1363054626" class="timestamp"><p>Ethan and Megan had told us about Thai restaurants in Nuremberg, and we decided to grab dinner there. We encountered snow flurries on the hour long autobahn ride, which made me nervous as our car has summer tires! Nothing stuck to the ground so it was all OK.</p><p>Osha Fine Thaikuche found us a table in the back, and we shared a yummy red curry and some summer rolls. We strolled around the reconstructed old city of Nuremburg, which is only the old city because it is within the old walls. Nuremburg was flattened in WWII, and now its is a very broad pedestrian shopping area,with several parallel pedestrian only streets. It also contains at least three large churches (why wasn't their large church a cathedral?), in different construction styles. Nuremburg seemed like a nice place to wander and people watch on a sunny day.</p><p>We returned back to Bamberg and found Ethan busy prepping for his next day at work. Megan seemed in good spirits too; it turned out they too had had Thai for dinner. We shared some travel stories and then went to bed.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363059551" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-HzvITYsAUEM/ViF5LVXpEuI/AAAAAAAAKyI/ZB-cnS6msT8/s288/IMG_8861.JPG" alt="20130312033911, "><span data-time="1363059551" class="timestamp"><p id="endOfEntry">&lt;End of Journal&gt;</p></span>

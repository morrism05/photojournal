<h2><a id="Pokhara and Annapurna Trail">Pokhara and Annapurna Trail</a></h2><h3><a id="1399359600">05/06/2014</a></h3><p>We woke up early this morning to get our bags ready for our departure from Shangri-La Hotel and to head to the airport. A little after 6am we left the room, dropping off our excess luggage with the bellhop for later retrieval. We went to the breakfast room for a quick stuffing of our faces before our 6:30am meet up with Tilak and our tour compatriots.</p><p>6:30am came and went and John and Marilyn were the only members of the group not present. We soon learned that Marilyn had been up all night with food poisoning and that she was doing so poorly that they were considering taking her to the hospital and that they would not be coming on the hike.</p><p>We left for the airport without them, cramming ourselves into the super narrow rows of the minibus.</p><p>At Kathmandu airport we hustled over to the domestic terminal, wondering if the airline would weigh our luggage and force us to shuffle weight between our bags. As it turned out, the security screenings and check-in process did not include any bag weighing today, and so we were able to put things which had been on our persons back into our bags.</p><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399386888" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-vDr7ZHc0ZGQ/U_dEgclIEFI/AAAAAAAACgw/3L7kTmwqRoo/s288/P1450899.JPG" alt="20140506143448, "><span data-time="1399386888" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399386888" class="timestamp"><p>The domestic terminal was a chaotic scene full of tourists in hiking and mountaineering gear being shepherded by Nepali guides. We had missed the Yeti Air 7:30am flight to Pokhara so we cooled our heels for a bit waiting for the 8:30am departure.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399388588" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-m2oOWQhx_jg/U_dEhqun1HI/AAAAAAAAChM/XuXqg2oeoDg/s288/P1450902.JPG" alt="20140506150308, "><span data-time="1399388588" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399388588" class="timestamp"><p>When it was time to board we first went in a bus which took us to the turboprop airplane. There was a large group of Japanese tourists in the bus with us, and when the doors opened to let us out to the plane the Japanese all rushed for the plane so they could get seats first, beating me in my own plan. We ended up sitting on the right side of the plane just behind the wing.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399389143" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-QHqdvXDjgvA/U_dEjuscIQI/AAAAAAAAChQ/ttQvi5MV6pA/s288/P1450909.JPG" alt="20140506151223, "><span data-time="1399389143" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399389143" class="timestamp"><p>As we flew out of Kathmandu and west to Pokhara, we first departed the Kathmandu valley. The valley and particularly the city was blanketed in a low lying smog, but even the air above this blanket was hazy polluted white too. The air here was even worse than it had been in our flights over China.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399389301" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7javK-3bqBI/U_dEkYiIKvI/AAAAAAAAChg/XdGJMoYC-rA/s288/P1450914.JPG" alt="20140506151501, "><span data-time="1399389301" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399389301" class="timestamp"><p>After the Kathmandu valley were a series of mountain ridges. Most of the mountain slopes had terraced agriculture on them; where no crops were being grown green forests were found. Pokhara is in a valley of its own near a lake. The city is less dense settled than Kathmandu, and from the air it looked like most buildings had a little land too.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399390851" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-4dldlAP3_IY/U_dEr1tAh4I/AAAAAAAACi4/vTv4SGqYgwE/s288/P1450934.JPG" alt="20140506154051, "><span data-time="1399390851" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399390851" class="timestamp"><p>The plane landed and we were met by our driver and his Toyota Land Cruiser. Soon we were underway to Nayaphul. We exited Pokhara during the morning school commute; school children were all about heading to school. I noticed that the people of Pokhara are less stylishly dressed than those of Kathmandu. There is the same predominance of shops open to the highway and with many men and women manning the shops by just waiting around for someone to come in.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399393329" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-08Gn0IBam-E/U_bJvy4o-jI/AAAAAAAAA0M/tuzTovQdpk8/s288/IMG_2623.JPG" alt="20140506162209, "><span data-time="1399393329" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399393329" class="timestamp"><p>Once out of Pokhara proper the highway headed up and over a mountain pass. This was a very scenic portion of the drive, and the lovely ride was punctuated by moments of terror as large trucks barreled around the corners at us and filled the road. No accidents occurred but Sally seemed tested by the experience. Regardless, the long views down the valleys and the many terraced farms we passed were very nice to look at.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399396733" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-098NMjl6Ibw/U_dE6T0YxsI/AAAAAAAAClg/OxCf-a9g9hQ/s288/P1450977.JPG" alt="20140506171853, "><span data-time="1399396733" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399396733" class="timestamp"><p>Our driver dropped us off in Nayaphul. We assembled our packs and met the two guide understudies - Madan and Mingma - and the one porter who would accompany us. The understudies are students in tourism at a Kathmandu university. We did not learn much about the porter. Each student took one duffel and the porter bundled three duffels together into a unit so the could carry them all by himself (hung by a strap from his forehead!). We purchased some water and some coconut cookies as trail food.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399398499" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-iHXjVvs2QC8/U_dE9YJ8sFI/AAAAAAAACmA/zFO9yPlib-w/s288/P1450984.JPG" alt="20140506174819, "><span data-time="1399398499" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399398499" class="timestamp"><p>We first walked through Nayaphul. I was loving this rural town even with its dirt street and basic buildings. Nayaphul was so much nicer than the big Nepali cities we had been in that I could overlook its other flaws. Also, the air was finally breathable again.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399399798" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-9wpdgdeBA_4/U_dFDCI6d5I/AAAAAAAACnA/rg5s8g4WM-Q/s288/P1450996.JPG" alt="20140506180958, "><span data-time="1399399798" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399399798" class="timestamp"><p>Leaving Nayaphul we came to the Annapurna conservation area. From here we walked along a jeep road passing many farm plots of tomatoes, corn and beans. Chickens and water buffalo were also being farmed. As we walked up the river valley, we basically walked from town to town (each having a handful of guesthouses with restaurants) with farms in between. The towns are actually quite frequent, usually 30 minutes apart on foot.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399404139" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-g3rhsdGOgnE/U_dFMSV1TCI/AAAAAAAACow/yhwF1lP6tRs/s288/P1460014.JPG" alt="20140506192219, "><span data-time="1399404139" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399404139" class="timestamp"><p>At about 12:30p we stopped for lunch. Kat and I ordered Nepali daal bhat, which is supposed to be the national staple meal. Tilak ordered the same. We learned that with daal bhat you get free refills on the rice, daal and curried veggies. It was a very tasty meal, if one that took a long time to cook and present to us.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399410847" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-6Vr2T5Fofs0/U_dFQ-WW2mI/AAAAAAAACpk/ZhfOpatIDiU/s288/P1460021.JPG" alt="20140506211407, "><span data-time="1399410847" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399410847" class="timestamp"><p>At maybe 1:30pm, we set out again on the trail. The valley we were hiking had steep slopes on all sides. Even here there were many farms on these slopes, each cultivating terraced land. In this after-lunch period the trail really started turning steep.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399414602" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-bjmqVuCJ7PA/U_dFZlovLzI/AAAAAAAACrI/tif2O888Pk4/s288/P1460034.JPG" alt="20140506221642, "><span data-time="1399414602" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399414602" class="timestamp"><p>We eventually turned off of the jeep road and started walking a strictly pedestrian (and live stock!) path. The path is very well maintained and paved in flat stones. Climbs are done on stone staircases. The hike is very picturesque here, with greenery and trees all about, and pretty stone villages with flowers and blue painted roofs. Tilak wanted us to make more ground on this first day than our itinerary had originally called for. When we reached our prior scheduled breaking point Turkadunga for the night, we breezed on through only taking the time to enjoy its amazing suspension bridges over two beautiful waterfalls. This town also coincides with the end of the jeep road, so it is the last town which can receive supplies by truck.</p><p>The most challenging portion of the hike was from Turkadunga to Ulleri. This portion was simply a twisting stone staircase that climbs 400m in elevation. Again, the waterfall at the beginning of this climb was the prettiest thing in today's hike, but I also loved the tight terraces of corn being farmed and the fact as were walked we were following children on their way home from school.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399421087" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-o_ZIDAZ88r8/U_dFtdVQi_I/AAAAAAAACug/3DPi2Q2unRI/s288/P1460065.JPG" alt="20140507000447, "><span data-time="1399421087" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399421087" class="timestamp"><p>About halfway up the stairs to Ulleri deep cracking thunder filled the valley. Soon, it started to lightly rain and so we all pulled on our rain jackets and pack covers. Hiking in a rain jacket is a bit silly, as you substitute being wet with rain for being wet with sweat. Along this raining portion of the hike we were treated with a double rainbow.</p><p>Sally was struggling a bit with the steeper portions of today's hike, so the group moved slowly up the stairs. I was having a hard time doing the slow pace, and would pulse ahead and then wait for the others to catch up. (I think this may have annoyed the guides, and I got a little lecture after dinner.)</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399423719" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ZTWyklXc-GA/U_dF2GG5-4I/AAAAAAAACwk/EFpjtp8ny9o/s288/P1460081.JPG" alt="20140507004839, "><span data-time="1399423719" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399423719" class="timestamp"><p>Eventually we made it to Ulleri and our guest house. (Alas, it does not have a western toilet like the three or four other GHs we passed.) Here we took in long views up and down the mountain ravine. Way up the ravine is Annapurna Mountain South, and we caught a glimpse or two of it through breaks in the clouds.</p><p>Katrina and Trevor discovered that they had bloody bites on there legs. We think that the pair likely were nibbled by leaches.</p></span><span data-time="1399430287" class="timestamp"><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399424788" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ab00YS_K4fY/U_dF6EytpGI/AAAAAAAACyI/litQAm7uhwM/s288/P1460089.JPG" alt="20140507010628, "><p>We took hot showers at the guesthouse and then had a hot dinner of Nepali curry, momo and eggs. Katrina has a hormone headache so she did not eat much. We heard a little from Tilak about our hike for tomorrow, and then we all headed up for bed.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399430559" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-lM4WK5VEp9w/U_dF-ApvLVI/AAAAAAAACyg/uCsQrjsQZP8/s288/P1460098.JPG" alt="20140507024239, "><span data-time="1399430559" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399430559" class="timestamp"><p>Today's hike in was so beautiful! I really like seeing so many productive and green terraces, beautiful towns and farms, river beds with swimming holes and rushing waterfalls. Today was certainly up there with Desolation Wilderness and Milford Track in terms of the most beautiful hikes I have done!</p><p id="endOfEntry">&lt;End of Journal&gt;</p></span></span>

We ate breakfast in the hotel around 8:30am, then we went out to the Rifare mall to see if Katrina could find a sake set she liked.</p><p>We had a little disagreement over the sake set; I was not mustering much enthusiasm for spending $100 on a sake pitcher and two little cups and Katrina wanted more support and encouragement from me with regards to the purchase. That said, I can understand a desire to buy local art to bring some beauty from your trip back to your home. I support this buying if that is what Katrina would like to do, but I would not do it under my own initiative.</p><p>Anyway, we did not find anything we wanted at Rifare. We returned to the hotel, checked out, and went to the train station to buy tickets and get some lunch supplies. We ended up getting some cheese flat breads at a German bakery to go with the carrots and tomatoes we had from yesterday. Katrina also found a sake set with nice light-blue color accented by silver overlay that she purchased. It was about $55 and I do think its pretty.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402340387" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-leQA4oOxf7Q/Vky2WHrQOdI/AAAAAAAAfb0/mcuWL_50kSU/s288/P1500063.JPG" alt="20140609185947, "><span data-time="1402340387" class="timestamp"><p>Our 10:55am train was the same Thunderbird line we took from Osaka to Kanazawa. Our return to Kyoto took a bit more than two hours.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402346859" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-GDzOFJWR_KE/Vky2WBQ7P5I/AAAAAAAAfb0/pVFFQab5NWE/s288/P1500068.JPG" alt="20140609204739, "><span data-time="1402346859" class="timestamp"><p>Once in Kyoto we walked north of the station for ten minutes to get to Goji-dori and the Citadine hotel. The hotel is a very modern western style hotel. Our room has a small cooktop, refrigerator and sink that we plan on using.</p><p>We left the hotel by bus to go to Kiyomizo-dera temple. It was a few blocks walk up the hill from the bus stop, and we passed store after store of Kyoto gift candies (soft mochi triangles with a fruit filling), ice cream, tea and coffee. I had forgotten how touristy Kyoto really is! I was no longer used to seeing so many western faces all about, but western tourists are certainly on to Kyoto!</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402352726" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-S6l4qftfQto/Vky2WD7-xbI/AAAAAAAAfb0/rJqoIex_HKg/s288/P1500073.JPG" alt="20140609222526, "><span data-time="1402352726" class="timestamp"><p>Kiyomizo-dera was mobbed with tourists too. There were a mix of westerners, Japanese school kids, Japanese tourists and even a few Japanese dressed in geisha costume. Unfortunately a number of the pagodas and temples were under restoration and covered in scaffolding and canvas. The main temple however was open and its iconic porch which overlooks the wooded hillside down into the heart of Kyoto was open too. We enjoyed the view and walked around to look back at the temple from other viewpoints.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402353875" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-5Yw1wZzL5Ks/Vky2WJzz09I/AAAAAAAAfV0/1UMVMzcA3es/s288/IMG_4766.JPG" alt="20140609224435, "><span data-time="1402353875" class="timestamp"><p>Also in Kiyomizo-dera is the Jishu shrine to love and romance. Here there are two stones set in the pavement 18m apart. If you walk eyes-closed from one stone towards the other saying the name of your love and you make it to the other stone then your love will stay true. If you stray from the path then it is time to find a new love! The crowds were so much around the stones that we did not see many people trying this journey. One young school boy started the walk but was stopped by his classmates when he nearly walked straight into the back of a tourist. Another school boy did make the venture. Katrina and I did not try; are we too chicken to test the veracity of the myth?</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402354379" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Uv3yuGDinx4/Vky2WDwUqqI/AAAAAAAAfV0/x5iasZqoIFQ/s288/189-P1500082.JPG" alt="20140609225259, "><span data-time="1402354379" class="timestamp"><p>While in Jishu shrine we were approached by four middle-school Japanese. The young men asked me if I would participate in their school assignment. I said I would. They interviewed me and asked me my name, how to spell it, where I was from, if I liked soccer, if I liked Japan and what was my favorite thing in Kyoto. It was very fun to interact with them, even if I could not always understand what they were asking!</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402354553" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-BQQ1GOuQqWM/Vky2WFzST7I/AAAAAAAAfbw/3Owxhmb09ck/s288/P1500083.JPG" alt="20140609225553, "><span data-time="1402354553" class="timestamp"><p>We took in a few more views of the elevated porch and then went to the waterfall/fountains on the temple grounds. It is said that if you drink from this water then either you will have your illness cured or you will become beautiful. We joined the long line to drink this water and were tickled to see that the cups from which you drink are sterilized between use in a UV machine. The water tasted good, better than the water from the hotel tap for sure.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402357421" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-D78EY8H9nZw/Vky2WEyPp5I/AAAAAAAAfbs/-8AdRM-ECIw/s288/IMG_4784.JPG" alt="20140609234341, "><span data-time="1402357421" class="timestamp"><p>We then walked the small streets between Kiyomizo-dera and Kodai-ji temple. This area is also saturated with tourist shops; we went from store to store sampling the mochi sweets at first. We also found more rice cakes being sold and tried the seven-seasons flavor, which I thought was very good and spicy. As we neared Kodai-ji the streets started looking familiar to me from our visit four years ago. We walked down the little Ishibei Komichi Path with its charming villa walls; Katrina has a nice photo of this path from our prior visit.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402366018" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_SSnL3unyEQ/Vky2WF5cMCI/AAAAAAAAfbo/waGMCA0NvCg/s288/P1500115.JPG" alt="20140610020658, "><span data-time="1402366018" class="timestamp"><p>It was closing in on dinner time so we took the bus back to the hotel. We did some grocery shopping for soap and a sponge at the 100 Yen store, then bought produce and dairy at the supermarket. The bill came to $42, which is more expensive than at home but which is not so bad for a veggie heavy dinner, a breakfast and a lunch. For dinner Katrina made a big salad of lettuce, peppers, tomato, avocado, cucumber and carrots. I made a stir fry with onion, garlic, broccoli, squash, carrot and mushroom. We also enjoyed the Kanazawa sake in our new sake set.</p><p>We have realized that there are two or three top tourist sights in Kyoto which require reservations which we do not have. As such, I feel like we need to do more planning for the rest of visit so that we don't miss other things we would like to see. Thus, I spent some time this evening looking over the UNESCO sites in Kyoto (there are 17!) and reading guides.</p><p id="endOfEntry">&lt;End of Journal&gt;</p></span>

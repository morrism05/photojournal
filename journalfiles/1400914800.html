<h2><a id="Siem Reap">Siem Reap</a></h2><h3><a id="1400914800">05/24/2014</a></h3><p>At about 2:30am this morning Katrina woke up and checked her email. Her father had sent her several reports on the safety of Thailand. Most of the reports basically stated that there had been no violence since the coup. However future stability was unknown, and the US State Department had started advising Americans to only travel to Thailand if it was unavoidable. This news kept me up for another hour or so.</p><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400942957" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ncp7OiAIUTw/VkoaOVbJ8wI/AAAAAAAAfLc/B-OYIZty1Ds/s288/P1480060.JPG" alt="20140524144917, "><span data-time="1400942957" class="timestamp"><p>When we awoke for good, we got ready for the day and then went to the poolside reception to get breakfast. We were able to order off a menu - we both got eggs with baguette and croissant, and I also had yogurt. The French baked goods were really good.</p><p>Our guide Set met us at 8:30am as planned, and our first stop was to go to Ankgor Wat to get our 3-day tourist passes for the temples. Along the way we discussed the itinerary for the day. The plan had been to go do a boat tour first so that we could see some over-water houses on the edge of the great lake, but Katrina had some doubts about the plan since she heard the trip was unpleasant in the hot weather when the water is low. Set agreed that the river has lots of mud and can be stinky at this time of year, but would not go so far as to outright recommend against the boat ride. We settled on rearranging the order of the day so that we would do our city and temple stuff first and decide on the boat tour later.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400946838" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-l_pV2O89qdM/VkoaOeSOFJI/AAAAAAAAfLc/cHBFi1oEal0/s288/P1480064.JPG" alt="20140524155358, "><span data-time="1400946838" class="timestamp"><p>At the Ankgor Wat ticket center we had photo-ID tickets prepared for us ($40 each). We then went across the road to Wat Thmei where we heard about the dark history of Cambodia's recent past.</p><p>In the 1960's Pol Pot worked his way up through the Communist party to be the leader of Cambodia. He took his philosophy from Mao Tze Tong, and he lead the literal purging of all intellectuals and opposing voices from the country. In a few years he had killed millions of Cambodians who he saw as threats or undesirables. At Wat Thmei there is a display of skulls from Siem Reap's killing field (which Set says has been converted from a cemetery to an apartment complex in recent years) and memorials to the victims.</p><p>Set's own father was killed by the Khmer Rouge in this period. His father was university educated and spoke English and French, and he worked alongside the American military during our Vietnam War. For this reason he was arrested and executed by the Khmer Rouge. In all likelihood the three year old Set and his mother would have been executed too (it was Khmer Rouge policy to execute full families so there would be no one to avenge the killings) except that Set's mother sent him away to hide with his grandmother and Set's mother went into hiding herself.</p><p>Eventually the Khmer Rouge was driven from power when it pissed off the Vietnamese by attacking them, and the Vietnamese marched on Cambodia and conquered the country. Most of the Khmer Rouge headmen escaped jail time.</p><p>The removal of the Khmer Rouge by the Vietnamese was not the end of Cambodia's troubles, and the country went into a civil war which lasted until the late 1990's.</p><p>While at Wat Thmei Set got a call from the central ICS office in Bangkok. The central office was looking to answer our questions about the safety of Thailand and if we should cancel our Ko Samui tour. The office said our travels would not be effected by the new rules and curfew put out by the military coup and that we should not worry about traveling to Ko Samui. Set also seemed to think that the chances of the Bangkok airport being occupied and closed was very low given that martial law was currently in effect.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400948586" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-F8h_2eA8ccw/VkoaOWLidMI/AAAAAAAAfLc/PSsdQVwVwg8/s288/P1480066.JPG" alt="20140524162306, "><span data-time="1400948586" class="timestamp"><p>Our next stop of the morning was at Wat An Kau Sai. We actually did not see or do much of anything at this wat. However, in what I believe was a gesture of apology for missing us yesterday at the airport and getting off to a bad start, Set walked us into his neighborhood which is right behind the temple. His neighborhood has dirt streets and many walled compounds with large houses on modest sized lots. The walled houses looked pretty expensive to me.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400949429" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-xJMT9VjHffU/VkoaOf2ph4I/AAAAAAAAfN0/Xwp6H29czzI/s288/P1480076.JPG" alt="20140524163709, "><span data-time="1400949429" class="timestamp"><p>We walked to the end of his street where there is an outside food stand with covered seating. Here Set buys his breakfast of noodles or porridge every morning for about $1, and also gets coffee. His cousin happened to be at the restaurant as we stopped by. We walked down two more doors to where two middle age women and their elderly mother were preparing fish-cakes which they sell as lunch food to the neighbors. Their house was high on stilts and their kitchen space was the open air area under the stilts. Here Set told us how to say hello (june-reap-sue) and how to hold our hands in prayer/lotus form at different heights depending on what level of seniority the person we were greeting had over us. We practiced with the two women and mother.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400950036" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-hKHFYG0Pz6E/VkoaOWtpN4I/AAAAAAAAfN0/61ztQICkkiw/s288/P1480081.JPG" alt="20140524164716, "><span data-time="1400950036" class="timestamp"><p>We walked further down Set's street to his house. Set had learned that I like mangoes and so he was going to show me his mango trees and pick some mangoes for me to try. Set's house is in a compound with two houses, the other belonging to his wife's sister. Just down the block is another sister-in-law and his parents-in-law. We were introduced to Set's youngest daughter and his niece, and Set sat us at an outside dinning table and then went to fetch his mango picking pole.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400950232" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-C7lX7VJ9JlI/VkoaOc4YXEI/AAAAAAAAfN0/pBIsg5iqoOA/s288/P1480085.JPG" alt="20140524165032, "><span data-time="1400950232" class="timestamp"><p>The mango pole is a long bamboo stick with a lantern shaped basket at its end. The basket has an opening on one side that will nestle a mango inside. You then pull down on the pole and the mango is pulled from the tree. Set demonstrated the use of the pole to me but when he pulled down the first mango it seriously shook the upper branches of the tree. Five or six mangoes fell to the ground, and then Set was yelling at me to get away from the red ants. He had disrupted a nest of red biting ants which were in the tree and now they were on the ground around us and on Set's clothing. I was not bit but Set was dancing nervously for a few minutes and went inside to clear off his clothing.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400950321" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-RBagM5XDU18/VkoaOVWUQUI/AAAAAAAAfNw/Z-3UGEbvjkw/s288/P1480086.JPG" alt="20140524165201, "><span data-time="1400950321" class="timestamp"><p>When he returned he brought several mangoes from is fridge to us. We tried a yellow mango (like the ones we have in the US) and also a green mango. The yellow one was tastier to me. Set put aside eight mangoes for us to take back to the hotel with us. After we had eaten and washed Set called the driver to come pick us up (the driver had never been to Set's house), and as we pulled out of the driveway we passed Set's wife returning home!</p><p>It seems that Set, a self-described poor boy from a small village had married to a better off woman and was now living a comfortable life in Siem Reap. This family has a nice home and a car as well. We learned that Set's mother is still alive and that she is a fishmonger at the Siem Reap local market, where she resells fish from her lakeside village.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400952135" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-DoBp6gJxlBM/VkoaOTYCSzI/AAAAAAAAfNw/phTDcAnhYd0/s288/P1480088.JPG" alt="20140524172215, "><span data-time="1400952135" class="timestamp"><p>Our next stop was at Wat Bo. This wat is decorated with Hindu gods and demons instead of the typical Buddhist figures. What was most interesting and unexpected about this wat was when we pulled in Katrina noticed three nearly newborn kittens in the yard. The kittens were near a plastic sack and they were covered in ants. Set tried to shoo the kittens away from the ants; the stinging ants can be powerful enough to kill kittens. We very soon realized that there were even more kittens in the plastic sack! We tried to dump out the sack (without getting ant bites ourselves) and found five more kittens and the mother cat too. The mother ran off, and we were left looking at the helpless kittens. Set went and told the monks about the cats, and we presume the monks fetched them (as monks are not to kill anything or let anything die at the temple). We continued our tour.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400953134" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-s15TU5cc0-8/VkoaOTRruaI/AAAAAAAAfNs/OfvRa_wgIm4/s288/P1480100.JPG" alt="20140524173854, "><span data-time="1400953134" class="timestamp"><p>After this third temple we went to an artisan workshop which employs deaf and/or mute artists to create traditional works of art. They have workshops for carving, silkscreen painting, lacquering, gilding, and metal working. We went through a number of the workshops and watched what is essentially a production (reproduction?) line for Cambodian art artifacts.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400955142" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-wLxlNleZng4/VkoaOZnRo-I/AAAAAAAAfNs/QZ_uJ6pO0yc/s288/P1480108.JPG" alt="20140524181222, "><span data-time="1400955142" class="timestamp"><p>We had an early lunch at Orchidee Angkor restaurant. My pumpkin curry in a coconut was decent, but Katrina's stir fried veggies were uninspired.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400963693" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-2exdKndAF_Y/VkoaOVf4f9I/AAAAAAAAfNs/_xCegnrIbag/s288/P1480111.JPG" alt="20140524203453, "><span data-time="1400963693" class="timestamp"><p>Katrina and I decided to cancel the boat tour portion of the day. Since it was the height of the heat of the day we decided to go to the Ankgor National Museum. Set went off to get a massage while we explored the museum. The museum had fantastic air conditioning, and it contains a very large collection of the artifacts recovered from Ankgor Wat. We saw countless sculptures and wall carvings. The museum introduced us to the Hindu gods and goddesses and explained their back stories and alternate forms. It is the Hindu deities which are being celebrated in the temples of Ankgor Wat. The museum also showed the different styles of sculpture and architecture that came with different eras in which Ankgor Wat was constructed (from the 8th century to the 15th century). I found the museum to be a bit of information overload, but I think it will be helpful when I see the temples tomorrow.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400965277" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-j_HPOfj4rOs/VkoaOexmmmI/AAAAAAAAfNs/4zva7TD9PcA/s288/P1480112.JPG" alt="20140524210117, "><span data-time="1400965277" class="timestamp"><p>We left the museum at about 2pm and drove to the Roluos Group of temples which are the oldest temples in the area. We started with Preah Ko from 880 AD. This site has several brick temples that have been excavated and partially restored, though Set says the lintel carvings are original. As with most of the temples at Angkor Wat, the ones here were homage to ancestors, the living king, or god himself.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400967875" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-UaQ3uDu9VBs/VkoaOXfsWPI/AAAAAAAAfNo/ZYl0MOjeheo/s288/P1480128.JPG" alt="20140524214435, "><span data-time="1400967875" class="timestamp"><p>We went a bit further to Bakong. This temple site was originally constructed in the 9th century as well, but then it was rebuilt in stone blocks and the Angkor Wat style many years later by the king how built the main Ankgor Wat temple. We were able to climb up this step pyramid and look out over the forests from its heights. Bakong is also surrounded by a moat.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400969605" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-2lv8xoSAvXY/VkoaOVYoKJI/AAAAAAAAfNg/ruHv5WjegmI/s288/IMG_3913.JPG" alt="20140524221325, "><span data-time="1400969605" class="timestamp"><p>The last temple we visited is Lolei. Here are four partially reconstructed temple towers on the site of a functioning monastery. The towers were not that impressive after Bakong. Instead we turned our attention to a ritual going on inside the living temple. A family and a monk were chanting over a young women. Set said they were trying to drive an evil spirit from her. Set says that locals believe that evil spirits inhabit people based on astrological events, like being a child of one Chinese year when its opposing year is happening. One is likely to have bad luck in these circumstances, but the chanting ritual can drive away the evil and prevent the bad luck from occurring. Set said he once got a fortune of bad luck. His wife and mother wanted him to do the ritual to rid himself of this evil, but he did not make time to do it. A few weeks later he ended up in a motorcycle crash. Once he got out of the hospital he did the ritual (and sold the motorcycle!).</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400970715" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-LOqkI5ehrZI/VkoaOQgrDDI/AAAAAAAAfNg/G-lggwOxFg4/s288/P1480143.JPG" alt="20140524223155, "><span data-time="1400970715" class="timestamp"><p>We were dropped off at our hotel. We swam in the pool for a little while and then walked into town to get dinner at Chamkar Vegetarian Restaurant. Our bread with peanut wedding dip was nice, as was our amok entree, but our green curry was uninspiring.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400980620" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-njgWJTe564w/VkoaOWhSc0I/AAAAAAAAfNg/F15XIjG2_3U/s288/P1480155.JPG" alt="20140525011700, "><span data-time="1400980620" class="timestamp"><p>We went back to the hotel where we ate two of the gift mangoes and wrote in our journals.</p><p id="endOfEntry">&lt;End of Journal&gt;</p></span>

We had breakfast on the 5th floor patio dining area. The ever present omelet bar was available, as was cereal, yogurt, fruit, and waffles.</p><p>A bit before 8:30 we went into the lobby to wait for our ride to the Baan Hongnual Cookery School. The driver and cooking teacher Pam were already there, and so we hopped in the van and left the hotel.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400255415" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-x-p8Kk-oFXA/ViJ6W03-INI/AAAAAAAAUOY/1emDVVTzI7w/s288/P1470012.JPG" alt="20140516155015, "><span data-time="1400255415" class="timestamp"><p>The first stop was to go to a local market to meet the other students and to buy some of the ingredients for the class. The other students turned out to be a group of six boisterous French people, who were very busy cracking jokes and taking pictures of everything. Their guide/instructor gave some indication that she was a bit worn out keeping up with them.</p><p>In the market we were shown the various veggies that were available for our dishes (spring rolls, pad thai, cashew chicken/tofu, tom yum soup, red curry, papaya salad). One item that we had not seen before were some miniature eggplants about the size of a grape. These were purchased for the red curry. Also, the basil that was used was not the purplish Thai basil we get in the US.</p><p>We also shopped for mushrooms, noodles, and meat/fish. Many of the vendors were selling curry pastes too - when we found out that we would be using a pre-made paste for our red curry we were a bit disappointed. (Pam shared with us that she is a mother of a 7 month old, and that she cannot eat the spiciest of peppers right now because it upsets her daughter.)</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400256926" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-roQGaLj03Lc/VjeZksr1iDI/AAAAAAAAemc/YQ9Cug6xXXs/s288/IMG_20140516_091526.jpg" alt="20140516161526, "><span data-time="1400256926" class="timestamp"><p>The last vendor we visited was the fruit vendor. He was selling durian fruit, which is a big spiky fruit. We had seen durian (a cousin of jack fruit) on trees, and also our hotel had a notice saying that durian fruit was forbidden in the hotel. Curious, we asked Pam about the football-sized fruit and she helped us buy one. The buying process was interesting. First the vendor whacked the outside of the fruit with a stick (while holding it in a specially gloved hand so not to be poked by its spikes) and listened to the sound to find a good one. Then he cut open the thick outside skin with a big knife to reveal the white fruit encased inside. This fruit was wrapped around an irregularly shaped seed.</p><p>We tasted the durian fruit and found it to be a unique thing, maybe slightly similar in mouth feel to a hard but ripe avocado, but with unrelated flavor. Pam tried the durian too and said that this one was not completely ripe.</p><p>The fruit vendor then cut open a second durian for us, and it was ready/ripe. This one had even softer inner fruit, and it had that perfumey flavor to it like a lychee has. It also is a super strong smelling fruit, and when we brought our prize back to the van the driver immediately called it out.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400258390" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-wua5mHnl9P0/ViJ6W7Izw9I/AAAAAAAAUOY/wA0e4w8UybQ/s288/P1470030.JPG" alt="20140516163950, "><span data-time="1400258390" class="timestamp"><p>We arrived at the school, a large open-air kitchen/classroom under a corrugated roof, and put on kitchen slippers, aprons and chef's hats. The school is located in a fruit tree filled neighborhood of 1-acre or so plots, and the school has a little garden area of its own. Pam's manager smelled the durian fruit we were bring in and said there was no way it was going in the fridge!</p><p>(Two of the French party were not cooking but just watching, and the nice French woman took my camera and shot photos of us during the process.)</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400258747" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-pke7N01jBV0/ViJ6W1kYcEI/AAAAAAAAUOc/Gu_9DqoX9nk/s288/P1470037.JPG" alt="20140516164547, "><span data-time="1400258747" class="timestamp"><p>The first things we made were spring rolls and tom yum soup. Each student had his own cutting board and knifes, and we prepared the raw materials for each dish. We also rolled the spring rolls ourselves, being shown how to roll diagonally across the square dough and fold in the flapping edges when roll was halfway done. The spring rolls were fried in oil in a wok (were were told to slide them into the oil rather than drop them). We all also had individual burners for cooking tom yum soup. For this we started by making our broth of lemon grass, galangal and kafir lime leaves. Then we put in our other ingredients such as tomatoes, onions and mushrooms. Only at the end did we put in the flavoring sauces including chili paste, sugar, fish sauce. The very last thing to go in, after the burner is off, is the lime juice.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400262312" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-jMuzR2YRrp8/ViJ6W8_hs7I/AAAAAAAAUOc/FHJiT6e-TXE/s288/P1470073.JPG" alt="20140516174512, "><span data-time="1400262312" class="timestamp"><p>When both dishes were done we paused from the cooking and ate them. I was rather happy with my spring rolls, and I really like the tom yum soup which was pretty spicy. Most of the French people could not handle the spice of the tom yum soup and left it unfinished.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400263457" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-zDhxzLdsGXc/ViJ6WxwUJbI/AAAAAAAAUOc/zYGW2rJsVp4/s288/P1470076.JPG" alt="20140516180417, "><span data-time="1400263457" class="timestamp"><p>Our next round of cooking was cashew chicken (tofu in our case) and pad thai. The cooking method for the pad thai was interesting to learn. First we put in our tofu and garlic and fried them in the walk. Then we pushed them to the side, cracked the egg into the free space, and scrambled the egg. When the egg was half cooked we mixed it with the tofu and garlic. Then again we pushed our cooked food to the side of the wok, put in our slightly flexible (not cooked but not bone dry) noodles and added some water, and cooked the noodles on the free side of the walk. When they were getting soft we added in our sauces and stirred, pulling apart the noodles to prevent clumping. Finally, we added the bean sprouts and almost immediately turned off the burner and called the dish done.</p><p>The consistency of the pad thai was very excellent, and I hope the above process can be used when I attempt pad woonsen at home next time.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400268480" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-H3TA0vm780Q/ViJ6WwJ_KJI/AAAAAAAAUOc/7qJ8mDhljnE/s288/P1470090.JPG" alt="20140516192800, "><span data-time="1400268480" class="timestamp"><p>After eating the cashew tofu and pad thai we were pretty full, but we still had more to cook! The French party went back to their hotel, and so we had Pam's sole attention as we made the curry and papaya salad. For the red curry we first put some coconut milk into walk and cooked it while stirring until the coconut oil was starting to separate and show in the wok. (Neither Kat nor I really identified the coconut oil, but the milk was bubbling at this point.) Then we put in a small scoop of the prepared red curry paste and palm sugar and mixed it into the coconut milk. Then we put in all of the raw veggies into this mixture and let them cook. Pam kept adding a mixture of 1:1 coconut milk and water to the wok as the cooking evaporated liquid from the wok. At the very end we added the basil leaves and turned off the wok.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400269922" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-V16fyO_rugU/ViJ6W2EwthI/AAAAAAAAUOc/KsI81-lTYIY/s288/P1470099.JPG" alt="20140516195202, "><span data-time="1400269922" class="timestamp"><p>For the green papaya salad Pam shredded long strips of papaya and carrot in a bowl. Then, in a big wooden pestle we put in one garlic clove and several small chili peppers and mashed them. Then we added chopped long beans and mashed crushed those a bit. Then we added in the fish sauce, sugar and lime and mixed them in. Finally the shredded papaya and carrots and chopped tomatoes were added to the pestle and mixed too. The salad was topped with peanuts.</p><p>The red curry turned out very nicely (Pam noted that restaurants will often add MSG to their curries) but our papaya salad was a bit too spicy. Next time we will use two chilies instead of three.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400271360" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-P7PnvUOmXA8/ViJ6XHWkOuI/AAAAAAAAUOY/4wD6vX0Eo4A/s288/IMG_3344.JPG" alt="20140516201600, "><span data-time="1400271360" class="timestamp"><p>Pam then took us on a short tour of the garden, showing us galangal, lemon grass, chilies and eggplants among other things. This concluded our cooking day and we were driven back to the hotel. We did not bring back our leftover durian fruit!</p><p>Having been outside in the hot and sweated over the burners (and sweated over our spicy food!), we decide to relax in the room in the AC for a bit. Kat finished her book, I watched more videos. We took a quick dip in the super small pool, then came back to the room to shower and relax some more.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400284816" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-pdAdaqrY5_0/VjeZkvm1oLI/AAAAAAAAemg/ZoLVrThobEA/s288/IMG_20140517_070016.jpg" alt="20140517000016, "><span data-time="1400284816" class="timestamp"><p>At about 6pm (and 90 F) we went back outside to explore Chiang Mai on foot. We headed into the old city (which resides in the square defined by the city moat) and wandered around the streets. Beyond a few streets with restaurants and hotels, the old city is actually pretty quiet and is mostly residential. We passed by the wats we saw yesterday, but there really was not much in the old city that captured our attention.</p><p>After exploring it from east to west, we returned to the eastern edge where the Burmese restaurant The Swan is located and ordered fermented tea leaf salads for dinner.</p><p>Full again, we walked down Loi Khro Rd past all of the bars. Katrina has read that there is a large sex tourism industry here where western men come to the bars to pick up bar girls (prostitutes). And indeed we did see a fair number of gray haired white men chatting up younger Thai women on this bar street.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400296439" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-CQWhsqeR27o/ViJ6XNr7bjI/AAAAAAAAUOY/PUbmoqYpcOw/s288/P1470116.JPG" alt="20140517031359, "><span data-time="1400296439" class="timestamp"><p>The bar scene fades out into the night bazaar. There is a similar sidewalk vendor scene here to what we saw in Bangkok's night market, except that the sex-related items are missing and the available goods are more strictly touristy. Beyond the sidewalk stalls are also there are also open floor plan market buildings where more vendors have stalls. We walked through the basement of one market and saw many artists selling their paintings and drawings. There seems to be a fair number of artists that will paint you a large painting from a small photograph you provide. (Ian, we thought of you!) There are also prepared food markets in this bazaar area. We walked down the Halel alley and saw pad thai, soups, and small bites to eat being sold. Katrina had a fried corn cake, which tasted a bit like the sweet corn lump they serve at Chevy's.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400296490" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-fUUzxnT_0ZA/ViJ6XEc-fLI/AAAAAAAAUOY/1tOdc6cPpu8/s288/P1470117.JPG" alt="20140517031450, "><span data-time="1400296490" class="timestamp"><p>We returned to the hotel and got ready for bed.</p><p id="endOfEntry">&lt;End of Journal&gt;</p></span>

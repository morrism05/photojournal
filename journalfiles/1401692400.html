We had a lot of hiking in store and it was the only bus before 10 am.</p><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401715809" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ew3Qwbg5Ooo/Vky3VdXMCmI/AAAAAAAAfXs/j7ycrBbyrYE/s288/P1490047.JPG" alt="20140602133009, "><span data-time="1401715809" class="timestamp"><p>We packed up before breakfast, then, ready for the day, ate in the dining room. Our host had a plate of fruit, a hard boiled egg, toast with jam, a roll, and some yogurt for us. Clearly we were eating the western breakfast.</p><p>After breakfast we turned in our key and left for the bus stop. Just about two minutes out of the minshuku we realized we had left without our bento boxes! We turned back and when I asked for the boxes it was clear the host had forgotten we needed these too. He looked a little flustered and told us to go wait at the bus stop so that we would not miss our bus, and that he would drive us the lunch boxes very soon. We left the minshuku again, and at about 7:18 am the host arrived with our lunches.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401719087" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-bFJ2AA_G5KI/Vky3VdwvLbI/AAAAAAAAfXs/JJ8EohfMXBY/s288/P1490053.JPG" alt="20140602142447, "><span data-time="1401719087" class="timestamp"><p>We boarded the bus along with Ben and Dan. We told the driver we wanted to get off at Kobiro-toge. From yesterday we knew the price would be 390 yen. These local buses are very useful, but also very expensive!</p><p>We got off at our stop as planned, and when I looked behind I was surprised to see that Ben and Father had not disembarked too. I hoped they knew what they were doing because there were no other stops that service the Kumano Kodo trail on this bus route.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401720125" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-jyzy0Cs2G5k/Vky3VaDcs6I/AAAAAAAAfXs/3mwJPIl9Hz0/s288/P1490055.JPG" alt="20140602144205, "><span data-time="1401720125" class="timestamp"><p>Our hike today had four passes to climb. We started with the Waraji-toge pass. Right after leaving the bus stop, Kat spotted a monkey sprinting for the trees. The Waraji-toge climb was shorter because the bus had taken us up most of its height. Our climb was through cultivated forests. At the top of the pass a sign explained that Waraji are a type of reed shoes that people wore long ago, and that these shoes wore out very quickly. You might use two pairs in a day, and the top of Waraji pass was a place you might discard your worn out shoes if you started from Chikatsuyu.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401722513" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-fHdqJ8duthE/Vky3VZyrWaI/AAAAAAAAfXs/pmmcCXn4YGA/s288/P1490067.JPG" alt="20140602152153, "><span data-time="1401722513" class="timestamp"><p>We descended from this pass and soon reached the detour before trail marker 44. Signs explained that the next section of Kumano Kodo trail was dangerous because there was a slip in the mountain which could fall at any time. We were detoured south on a forest road, and shortly guided on to the detour trail which climbed Iwagami-toge Pass (650m).</p><p>It turned out that the detour trail was actually the most beautiful section of today's hike! The trail climbed up the pass through some real wild forests, with lots of undergrowth and a fair number of flowers too. As we climbed across a bowl on the mountain face, we entered an area of prior clear cutting which gave us great views across the mountains to the west.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401724969" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ODgLnX09ILE/Vky3VVjfCxI/AAAAAAAAfXs/5Yet1usmYK0/s288/P1490090.JPG" alt="20140602160249, "><span data-time="1401724969" class="timestamp"><p>We descended from Iwagami-toge, taking a stop along the way to munch on our snow peas. This descent was through more forestry lands. At higher elevations we were in nice forest, then we dropped down onto a logging road (which reminded me of walking around at Orchard Hill) and followed it most of the way to Jagata Jizo shrine. The last little bit of the approach to Jagata Jizo was through more abandoned farming terraces which are now growing lumber.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401727623" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-4-spP3Mh9kY/Vky3VXZ2MsI/AAAAAAAAfXs/XfjN_zp_t38/s288/IMG_4265.JPG" alt="20140602164703, "><span data-time="1401727623" class="timestamp"><p>At Jagata Jizo we admired the dragon-headed spigot, then rejoined the Kumano Kodo trail. It was not very long before we were climbing yet another pass, Mikoshi-toge (548m). After summitting we descended past a waterfall to the "easy" part of the day, a few km along the Otonashi-gawa River. Along the river we started seeing some Japanese Maple trees, and we also spotted a snake.</p><p>(Katrina now thinks that she just spotted a blue tailed lizard yesterday, instead of a blue Japanese Rat Snake.)</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401733818" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-b-78YyKCUtY/Vky3Vf4KNyI/AAAAAAAAfXs/4MpUzPJQ5pM/s288/P1490132.JPG" alt="20140602183018, "><span data-time="1401733818" class="timestamp"><p>We made it to the junction of the Nakahechi route (the route we had been hiking) and the Akagi-goe route at Nakahechi marker 59 (meaning 29.5km from the start). Here, we at lunch outside of the restrooms. Our lunch boxes had a banana, half an orange, and two rice balls with pickled and soy sauce dipped vegetables inside.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401735595" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-wmqCYyov7MY/Vky3VaFyESI/AAAAAAAAfXU/U85YxbJRZHk/s288/IMG_4276.JPG" alt="20140602185955, "><span data-time="1401735595" class="timestamp"><p>We then started the last climb of the day, a grueling 191m up out of the river valley and to the top of the adjacent ridge (440m). The ascent was through more forestry land, and once we crested the ridge we saw lots and lots of abandoned terraces growing lumber. We walked along the ridge top for 4km or so. This was one of the nicer sections, and we would often have views of the mountain ranges to the north-east and south west. It is mountains beyond mountains here! It is quite a rugged, tree-filled landscape on the Kii Peninsula! While walking along this ridge we also passed through evergreen forest with beautiful fern ground cover. As we started descending towards Yunomine, the landscape turned drier and fallen leaves covered the trail, making for tricky footing. I was tired by all of the hiking from today and was not in the best of spirits.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401743025" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-I-Lda-6v9F8/Vky3VQdkiGI/AAAAAAAAfXs/douSDGEUyA4/s288/P1490185.JPG" alt="20140602210345, "><span data-time="1401743025" class="timestamp"><p>We finally made it to Yunomine at about 2 pm (after 15km, 602m ascended and 1013m descended), and discovered the town has a very strong scent of sulfur. The town is strung along a small river gorge, and hot springs percolate through the river walls and into the flowing water. The town has tapped these hot-springs to fill several onsen. One of the littlest onsen is a small hut built over the river which couples can rent for their exclusive use. Katrina says this onsen hut is a UNESCO site.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401743399" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-mG4rAydOBP8/Vky3VQTTJ7I/AAAAAAAAfXo/ZXpOCmwF_-4/s288/P1490194.JPG" alt="20140602210959, "><span data-time="1401743399" class="timestamp"><p>Just a few yards downstream is a rectangular basin of hot-spring water that the town has captured for the boiling of eggs and sweet-potatoes. Katrina and I went into a little market and purchased a netted bag with three eggs inside. The store had a sign indicating that it takes 13 minutes to cook your eggs in the basin and about one hour to cook a sweet potato. We also bought two chocolate ice cream bars and sat by the boiling basin eating our ice cream as we waited on our eggs to cook.</p><p>(As we were waiting we saw a bus pull up and Ben and Dan disembarked and headed into our ryokan for the night.)</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401746007" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_UWnajz2AOY/Vky3VSuNEjI/AAAAAAAAfXk/cLECvWbRtTM/s288/P1490211.JPG" alt="20140602215327, "><span data-time="1401746007" class="timestamp"><p>Once our eggs were cooked we went and checked into the Yoshinoya Ryokan ourselves. We were shown what must be the best room in the house. It is an eight tatami mat large room over the corner of the building. Looking out our windows we can see and hear the river running by, look down the hill/road to the small onsen and hot spring basin and see the end of the Kumano Kodo trail we hiked into town. Basically, we feel like we can see all of Yunomine. The decor of the room is very nice too, with all of the rice paper windows and doors. We also have a mini-shrine in our room!</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401748248" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-6tLHRofG0-s/Vky3VeMEtZI/AAAAAAAAfXs/BdBsGBpSyCU/s288/P1490216.JPG" alt="20140602223048, "><span data-time="1401748248" class="timestamp"><p>The other excellent thing about our hotel is that they have their own private onsen that couples can reserve. We put on our robes and went to the pool almost immediately. The onsen has a stone soaking pool that is outside with green trees all around. Right next to the soaking pool is a small coy pond. There was no hot water spigot for washing prior to entering the soaking pool, so we dipped our wash bowls into the soaking pool water and poured it over ourselves while washing. We then used the provided paddle to mix the hot spring water which was flowing in from one corner with the cold water tap which was flowing from the other, and found a good balance of heat. We soaked for a little while and enjoyed the ambiance. After we finished our soak, I poured a few bowls full of cold water over my body so I would not leave the spa sweating as I have done in days passed!</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401752004" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--Jnk7HqB5A4/Vky3VUHklsI/AAAAAAAAfXU/9yxdHfrUYn0/s288/IMG_4303.JPG" alt="20140602233324, "><span data-time="1401752004" class="timestamp"><p>An hour later we got on a bus and went to Kawayu just six minutes down the road. Kawayu has the broad Oto river running through it, and on its rocky shores there are hot spring waters which come to the surface. We walked alone the rocky shore and came to a place where the locals had dug back the stones to create a generous pool of hot spring water. The water is too hot for bathing, so the locals also dug a channel from the cold river into the hot pool. Two rock plugging the channel can be removed to mix the hot and cold waters and make an appealing soaking environment.</p><p>We only had 30 minutes between arriving at Kawayu and when we would need to catch the bus back to dinner, so we did not play with the temperature of the large pool too much. Instead, we waded around where the hot pool flowed out back into the cold river. Some places where we would step the hot water would be floating on the surface and the cold water would be on the river bottom. Other places a hot spring would be percolating up out of the river bottom and the cold water would be flowing on top. It was fun to carefully move around in this environment. I would have enjoyed spending several hours here.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401754443" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-u5_kucIlcBs/Vky3VR4ECTI/AAAAAAAAfXs/5iTFNgIKlu8/s288/IMG_20140602_171403.jpg" alt="20140603001403, "><span data-time="1401754443" class="timestamp"><p>We also watched as just down stream a group of elderly Japanese ladies came down to the river in pink robes and got into a similar hot pool on the bank of the river. They seemed to be enjoying the experience!</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401755519" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--xMiFu8hw4Q/Vky3Vbc4XrI/AAAAAAAAfXs/th4L26OAe3U/s288/P1490246.JPG" alt="20140603003159, "><span data-time="1401755519" class="timestamp"><p>We went back to our ryokan, relaxed and enjoyed our room, wrote our journals, and at 7 pm went down for dinner. This dinner was very challenging for me, as it is the first ryokan that does not have a fish-less vegetarian meal. I tried to be game and eat the fish put on my plate. I had the tuna sushimi (which I was surprised to find had very little fishy taste, in fact it was more of a texture experience than a flavor experience for me), and the smoked fish (this tasted like the fish I remember from childhood, which I think was mostly trout). The prawns with heads I gave to Katrina, and after glumly eating the pieces of fish and being very put off by the ordeal I also gave her my fried fish on sticks. I must have had a pretty miserable expression on my face because I think I spoiled Katrina's enjoyment of the fish too!</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401762673" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-OrvwqQmS-1k/Vky3VU40jDI/AAAAAAAAfXs/DSIYhr4JipI/s288/P1490254.JPG" alt="20140603023113, "><span data-time="1401762673" class="timestamp"><p>I must admit I am not at all looking forward to the fish which will be in my bento box lunch tomorrow. At least I have the hot-spring hard boiled eggs available.</p><p>After dinner we went back to the room and calculated the various distances and elevation changes for each day of our intended journey.<br>Day 1 - 3.71km and 254m up<br>Day 2 - 16.3km and 625m up<br>Day 3 (today) - 15km and 602m up<br>Day 4 - 16.4km and 632m up<br>Day 5 - 14.5km and 978m up</p><p>This is quite a challenge for us!</p><p id="endOfEntry">&lt;End of Journal&gt;</p></span>

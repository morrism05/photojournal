<h2><a id="Kumano Kodo: Yunomine to Koguchi">Kumano Kodo: Yunomine to Koguchi</a></h2><h3><a id="1401778800">06/03/2014</a></h3><p>Last night we had debated about whether we should hike from Yunomine to Kumano Hongu Taisha or if we should take the bus. We knew that our hike today with that section included would be as long as our hike from yesterday, and we were tired from all of the walking yesterday. Ultimately we decided that we would include the section to Kumano Hongu Taisha at the beginning of our day. However, that meant we would need to leave early so that we would have time to visit the temples and tori gate in Hongu and still make the 9:55am bus. Thus, we requested a 6:30am breakfast so we could get our early start.</p><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401802329" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-pcsUhbvnWfE/Vky3VQoIEAI/AAAAAAAAfXs/SG9GuuolUJc/s288/P1490255.JPG" alt="20140603133209, "><span data-time="1401802329" class="timestamp"><p>We awoke at 6am, packed our bags and went down to breakfast. We found a breakfast of poached egg, pickled vegetables, smoked fish and miso soup. I gave Katrina my fish.</p><p>After we finished eating, I went to ask our host about our bento box lunches for the day. Our host looked confused, and said there were no lunches for us. I insisted that we had paid for lunches, and he said he could go out to the store and get us lunches if we needed. At this point Katrina double checked our voucher and saw that this hotel did not have lunches available, and that we had not paid for them. Oops.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401804207" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_ygPmsY842w/Vky3VdgR0PI/AAAAAAAAfXo/GyLoPwHroZ4/s288/P1490257.JPG" alt="20140603140327, "><span data-time="1401804207" class="timestamp"><p>We left the hotel just before 7am, walked along the sulfurous river, and got on the Dainichi-goe section of the Kumano Kodo. This section was up and over the hill to Hongu, and it took us about one hour to complete. The scenery was the fern forest we had come so familiar with. We were feeling tired in the legs from yesterday's excursions, and moved more slowly here. The nicest part of the 3.4km hike was towards the end, when we passed a shrine with more old cedar trees.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401807735" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XlO49pT9Ljw/Vky3VSgR_qI/AAAAAAAAfXs/gk45Y1dAK44/s288/P1490274.JPG" alt="20140603150215, "><span data-time="1401807735" class="timestamp"><p>Hongu is the biggest town we have seen since starting our hike. It lies along the banks of the Kumano-gawa River. This river clearly is a much larger flow at other points of year, because the water only fills a small portion of the broad rocky river wash.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401808544" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-34X16nHc1L0/Vky3VTRu7PI/AAAAAAAAfXs/C2fbPJTPWio/s288/P1490276.JPG" alt="20140603151544, "><span data-time="1401808544" class="timestamp"><p>We went first to the old site of the Kumano Hongu Taisha temples, along the river shore. The temple complex was here until the late 1880's, when it was damaged by flooding. The temples were then dismantled, moved and reassembled at their new location 1km away on a hill. The old site is now a forest and grass memorial, and near by is the biggest tori gate in the world.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401808933" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_0oFo1tgr1E/Vky3VXMxjnI/AAAAAAAAfXs/OSD3v_9_vHA/s288/P1490277.JPG" alt="20140603152213, "><span data-time="1401808933" class="timestamp"><p>We walked through the Oyunohara tori gate, passed the town rice fields, and back on to the main street. We looked for a place to buy lunch food, but at 8:30am and none of the cafes were open! So we went to the Hongu temple itself. The entry was a long staircase lined with flags to get up to the temple. The temple complex had a large gate through which the relocated temples were accessed, and then a newer temple which look out on the older one. In the newer temple a woman was doing a dance to music. We later figured out that this was some sort of a preliminary ceremony before a donor brought an offering to one of the old temples. We saw a priest leading a well dressed (business?) man to the old temple, leading him in, doing a small ceremony and sending him up the steps to make his offering. I was wondering if the man might have been starting a new business or endeavor.</p><p>As we left the temples via the stair cases as a group of school children were arriving. May of them took the chance to greet us with "hello!" We hello'ed back and I also konichiwa'ed.</p><p>We grabbed a map at the Kumano Kodo visitor center with markings of all the restaurants and stores in town. With this map we found a small bento box and sushi shop were we purchased inari and fried rice for lunch. We also checked in the little convenience store across the road, and found they actually had some fresh fruit and vegetables too. We purchased apples and I got a pastry.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401813369" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-AiZGjqiVdYI/Vky3VX_ojsI/AAAAAAAAfXs/-tPG-ajGMMk/s288/P1490297.JPG" alt="20140603163609, "><span data-time="1401813369" class="timestamp"><p>We caught a bus from the visitor center to the Ukegawa bus stop (just a few km down the river) and then started our long hike of the day on the Kogumotori-goe section of the Kumano Kodo. This is a 13km section of trail that starts with a long ascent up the mountain to a height of about 450m. Because the ascent was gradual and the trail was so beautiful groomed - two to three people wide and very well graded - the climb was not so tiring. This is not to say we weren't tired, but rather that we could find a comfortable pace through the climb.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401819365" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SY1kZdWho-s/Vky3VRBLwHI/AAAAAAAAfXk/LNleyxvdj_g/s288/P1490319.JPG" alt="20140603181605, "><span data-time="1401819365" class="timestamp"><p>During this climb we tried out the hard boiled eggs from yesterday. They were eggier than they would otherwise have been due to the sulfurous water they had been boiled in.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401820335" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Jmcnvfir7JI/Vky3VY8FPBI/AAAAAAAAfXo/2DfPcVx_h34/s288/P1490325.JPG" alt="20140603183215, "><span data-time="1401820335" class="timestamp"><p>About 5km into the hike we came to the Hyakken-gura cliff which had the best views of our trek to date. We were able to look well off into the west over about 180-degrees of space. It is very possible we were looking at mountains we had hiked on prior days. At Hyakken-gura we ate our inari and an apple. We also chatted with an Australian and three Czech hikers walking in our direction.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401822346" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-11kbVtNtfBU/Vky3VaQbJkI/AAAAAAAAfXs/w4hqqAyGFlQ/s288/P1490340.JPG" alt="20140603190546, "><span data-time="1401822346" class="timestamp"><p>The trail continued on mostly flat. The forests on the Kogumotori-goe were pretty consistently cedar forests with fantastic fern ground-cover. The new crop of young ferns is lighter green, and rises higher above the darker green old ferns. The young ferns branch out in a V-shape too, and when I'd look up or down a slope there would be an interesting cross-hatching like appearance to the foliage.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401823996" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-9Je7oaY9OT4/Vky3VQUuj1I/AAAAAAAAfXo/ON5lCCF5jdU/s288/P1490344.JPG" alt="20140603193316, "><span data-time="1401823996" class="timestamp"><p>We made a few more stops along the way, one at the restrooms and another at a tea house remains to eat our vegetable fried rice.</p><p>On the long descent to the Akagi-gawa River we passed a number of poem monuments. Katrina had hoped there would be translations but there were not.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401832235" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Z50dXPIDdqI/Vky3VSpaNXI/AAAAAAAAfXs/g6ya1H-814Q/s288/P1490378.JPG" alt="20140603215035, "><span data-time="1401832235" class="timestamp"><p>Upon reaching the river, we walked along the road for 1km into Koguchi, but did not see any signs guiding us to our minshuku. I went into the larger hotel in town to ask for directions, but the man at the hotel desk had trouble understanding that I was looking for his competitor hotel at first. Eventually he understood, and took me to his car and drove me the three blocks to Momofuku Minshuku. This was a very kind act on his part, and probably easier than him giving me directions!</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401834281" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XaetY8CSSmQ/Vky3VV3_czI/AAAAAAAAfXs/HTUJfPYpvlg/s288/P1490382.JPG" alt="20140603222441, "><span data-time="1401834281" class="timestamp"><p>Our room here has two parts. The tea room is four and a half tatami mats large. Here we found tea and mochi balls when we arrived. Our sleeping room is six mats large.</p><p>Our host here has OK command of English, but inserts "hanno" (the Japanese umm) in between many words making it harder to understand him. I did try to explain to him that I don't eat meat and I don't eat fish, so more vegetables for my dinner would be excellent. He did not get the message.</p><p>We talked with the two other guests at the minshuku, Joy (NY) and Annemarie (LA). They have learned that tomorrow it will be very rainy. We are thinking we will call off our long hike and just take a bus instead, as the trails here have been slippery even in the dry with leaves covering the ground and moss on the stone steps. It is a shame, as we feel very close to completing the trek! We planned with them how we could get the Nachi-san waterfall temple by bus, then swapped stories of travels and home life. Joy and Annemarie are both mothers with young children at home, so we got a little taste of motherhood too.</p><p>The biggest event in Joy and Annemarie's hike was that last night at the Yunamine ryokan they had a poisonous makada centipede enter their room. They wounded it and trapped it under a waste bin. They then got the hotel host and showed him the centipede, and he almost jumped clear across the room in fear when he saw it. He disposed of it and said it was a big one. The women were still on centipede alert and worked up over the experience.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401843960" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-lCWEMMx4BU4/Vky3VWeB7XI/AAAAAAAAfXU/dPRngbt_TZU/s288/102-P1490385.JPG" alt="20140604010600, "><span data-time="1401843960" class="timestamp"><p>There was a beautiful dinner spread on the table tonight. I swapped Katrina my fish (sashimi and grilled fish) for her vegetable tempura, so I had plenty to eat. I also enjoyed the fresh fruit and the salad.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401848787" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-A9xyEZo3i5s/Vky3VTr-kvI/AAAAAAAAfXs/-UMx5gLsUOA/s288/P1490386.JPG" alt="20140604022627, "><span data-time="1401848787" class="timestamp"><p>We went to bed soon after dinner.</p><p id="endOfEntry">&lt;End of Journal&gt;</p></span>

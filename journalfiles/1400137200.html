<h2><a id="Bangkok to Chiang Mai">Bangkok to Chiang Mai</a></h2><h3><a id="1400137200">05/15/2014</a></h3><p>We woke, ate breakfast at the buffet (I enjoyed an omelet with veggies and chili flakes, as well as their mini waffles and pineapple) and finished packing. We used the in-room WiFi for a bit more, learning that our friend Melissa will be moving back to Palo Alto but not yet hearing if Katrina's sister landed a new job for which she had interviewed. At a little before 8am we went downstairs to meet Dom and our driver.</p><p>There was not much traffic on the way to the airport. Dom gave us some tips on what street markets to visit in Chiang Mai. When we arrived at the airport he checked us into the flight and then said goodbye. He has been a friendly and helpful guide and a good ambassador for Thailand!</p><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400168795" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-DjPmMrAnv0A/ViJ6W-U2yNI/AAAAAAAAUOc/7YrLtMJY8yE/s288/P1460927.JPG" alt="20140515154635, "><span data-time="1400168795" class="timestamp"><p>We were very early to our gate, so we used the internet and caught up on our journals.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400176960" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-cU8k3jDL9Hw/ViJ6W8v5DgI/AAAAAAAAUOc/hFIQ7iW9nKw/s288/P1460933.JPG" alt="20140515180240, "><span data-time="1400176960" class="timestamp"><p>The flight to Chiang Mai was largely uneventful. This Thai Airways plane had Fruit Loop colored seats, and interestingly the first row of economy class was marked as row 31 even though truly it was the 8th row or so. We took off and circled over Bangkok, getting a look at how close the city is to the sea/bay. We were served a very basic veggie sandwich. As we neared Chiang Mai the haze/smog thickened a bit, but we could still see that there are many orchards in this region.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400182581" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-eiyNHcsVdq8/ViJ6WxWVM8I/AAAAAAAAUOc/qZT37-bHKdg/s288/P1460943.JPG" alt="20140515193621, "><span data-time="1400182581" class="timestamp"><p>We were met outside of baggage claim by Nuk our new local guide. He was thinking of just taking us by 7-Eleven for a snack before beginning our tour (it was too early to check into the hotel), but we wanted a bigger meal. Thus, he took us to the university district where we stopped at Boat restaurant and had a curry and pad thai. The food was fine if mild. Lots of students and a few westerners were in the restaurant.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400185451" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-l5umPiLLF3o/ViJ6Ww0WE9I/AAAAAAAAUOc/CCI34s62B2U/s288/P1460947.JPG" alt="20140515202411, "><span data-time="1400185451" class="timestamp"><p>We finished lunch in 30 minutes and then Nuk and our driver took us up a wonderfully twisty mountain road to the Wat Phrathat Doi Suthep on the top of the mountain. This wat has fine views over Chiang Mai. The story is that one of the kings of this region had a relic of Buddha. He wanted to make a temple for the relic but did not know where to put it. So, he tied the relic to an elephant and let the elephant loose. Where the elephant stopped (died?) he build this temple. The temple area we visited has a rectangular building with wall murals chronicling the Buddha's life surrounding a round golden stupa. Nuk told us the story of Buddha as we went around. He also pointed out the various Buddha statues and indicated where each one came from and how different countries have different shaped Buddha statues. We also came across various figurines representing the days of the week (plus Wednesday night, which gets its own figure). Depending on which day you were born you would have a different character. I was born on Saturday (actually, it turns out that Nuk and I have the same birthday) and I have a strong character which is not easy to hurt. Katrina was born on a Sunday and she has a character which is a mediator and problem defuser.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400191099" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-T1NJV7C5LJU/ViJ6Wz8m58I/AAAAAAAAUOc/WK08Rn7VEwI/s288/P1460976.JPG" alt="20140515215819, "><span data-time="1400191099" class="timestamp"><p>We went back down the mountain and into town. We saw Wat Phra Sing which had a great red and gold motif (actually these colors were used on the mountain wat too) with a slim "northern Thai style" Buddha. In this wat Nuk showed us the 150 year old wall murals which were done by local artists but some of the elements of the mural where not local, causing confusion and doubt among historians. Nuk himself was a fine arts major and had drawn sketches of these murals for a class.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400193193" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-uSvi9tznrUs/ViJ6WyPcKeI/AAAAAAAAUOc/6r99kMArw-o/s288/P1460985.JPG" alt="20140515223313, "><span data-time="1400193193" class="timestamp"><p>The final Wat of the day was wat Chedi Luang, which contains an enormous brick pagoda (in step pyramid style) which had been partially destroyed by an earthquake in 1545. (Actually, Chiang Rai has been having earthquakes just this week!) This pagoda had snake staircase railings and rings of stone elements at its mid-height. Only one of the original elephants still exists, the others are recent reconstructions which have made some locals mad because they look more like African elephants than Thai elephants.</p><p>It was at this wat that Nuk told us how all white elephants (which must be white in seven key body parts) are property of the King of Thailand, and when such an elephant is found it is shipped to Bangkok.</p><p>Nuk is a bit of a character. He seems a bit chauvinistic at times, has a colorful collection of stories about his schooling and his local friends, and has lots of varied life experience as a monk (for 2 weeks!), a fine arts major and a tour guide. He tells good stories but is not sensitive to what is politically incorrect from an American viewpoint. He also seems to be greatly annoyed by the recent influx of Chinese tourists.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400196133" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-0-qdnbSQl6k/ViJ6W5YAo8I/AAAAAAAAUOc/zOBd2_Y93aE/s288/P1460997.JPG" alt="20140515232213, "><span data-time="1400196133" class="timestamp"><p>After the third wat we were dropped off at The Small, our hotel. Our room is smaller that the one in Bangkok, but it is not too bad at all. The main disappointment is that the hotel pool is closed.</p><p>We hung out in the room for awhile to escape the afternoon heat. While the temperature at the mountain wat was OK, it was very hot (90s F) and humid in town. We read, watched YouTube, and heard from Marissa about her new job offer.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400206627" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ihz_c7tJI8Q/ViJ6W91x6OI/AAAAAAAAUOY/WMchKQrhvrE/s288/P1470003.JPG" alt="20140516021707, "><span data-time="1400206627" class="timestamp"><p>We ventured out for dinner at about 7pm, after it had rained a little. The rain and the sunset had cooled the temperature, which we appreciated. Seeing as we are so close to Burma here, we seeked out a Burmese restaurant. The Swan restaurant is across the moat from the old city, and had outside-ish dining under a high corrugated tin roof. We ordered yam tua eggplant salad, lar toke fermented tea leaf salad, ner lung fried egg balls (Burmese matzo balls), and nam pid phu scrambled egg curry. After we ordered the waiter came back to our table and in a low voice asked it we liked spicy food. They way he said it made us feel like a secret message had just been passed to us. We told him yes, we liked spicy food. The tea leaf salad was the best of the lot (just as it is in the USA). We asked where the fermented tea leaves came from, and they said they were imported from Myanmar. It was a very tasty meal, though one with a little risk as some of the salads had fresh vegetables. We have not been as strict about staying away from fresh fruits and veggies in Thailand as we were in Nepal.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400208415" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-88EdiKpGvHg/ViJ6WxUaKVI/AAAAAAAAUOc/62PRr5ELL5w/s288/P1470006.JPG" alt="20140516024655, "><span data-time="1400208415" class="timestamp"><p>(Nuk told us that the Burmese people come to Thailand to work in service and labor jobs, similar to the way that some Mexicans come to the US. However, while the Thai government grants these Burmese working papers, it does not give them full documentation and so they are unable to open bank accounts here. Instead they often have their bosses hold their extra wages until the big holidays, when they request those wages and use them to travel back to Myanmar to visit family.)</p><p>After dinner we came back to the hotel to do more reading/relaxing and go to bed.</p><p id="endOfEntry">&lt;End of Journal&gt;</p></span>

We decided to forgo the longer by probably quicker autobahn route to Rothenberg ob der Tauber and instead took country highway 470, which is a straighter shot through farm country and past smaller towns. We still have not figured out what the crop is around here. Katrina did however notice that the towns started advertising wine instead of beer as their drink of choice.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363111896" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-bOofRZHCKgc/Vhgf7sk55sI/AAAAAAAAIAY/WFnwYx6yD-g/s288/P1400880.JPG" alt="20130312181136, "><span data-time="1363111896" class="timestamp"><p>We parked outside the old city walls of Rothenberg and entered the city on foot. The wall forms a complete loop around the old city, and in many places it is possible to a walk its ramparts. We walked a portion to the second or third gate. The walkway is a skinny wood boardwalk that is sheltered from the elements. It looks into the city, though at regular intervals are windows through the wall to the outside town.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363112462" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-0bAzC1_lJ9o/VhggBsRxGHI/AAAAAAAAIBQ/3qobH0YSln8/s288/P1400889.JPG" alt="20130312182102, "><span data-time="1363112462" class="timestamp"><p>We descended from the wall and found the most prominent church - St James. The highlight of this Lutheran church was again its stained glass windows (which really were not comparable to those from Regensberg) and its carved wood alter in the rear of the church.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363114041" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-iG358kAiwmA/VhggP_bsA2I/AAAAAAAAIDM/96b8ja7fHFM/s288/P1400916.JPG" alt="20130312184721, "><span data-time="1363114041" class="timestamp"><p>At noon we headed to the Rathaus/market square to see the city's most famous cuckoo clock. The city has a famous tale (true) from when it was conquered in the 30 Years War. The conquering commander was challenged to drink a 6 pint beer. Thinking the task impossible and knowing he could not down that quantity of beer himself, he said if there was anyone of Rothenberg that could drink the 6 pint tankard then he would spare the town from further pillaging. The Rothenberg mayor accepted the challenge and successfully drank the 6 pints. In his honor, every hour during the day the town square cuckoo clock opens and shows the mayor downing his large beer.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363115192" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-glnOpzvVpMY/VhggdClYGwI/AAAAAAAAIFM/_TqpvxGnmQc/s288/P1400937.JPG" alt="20130312190632, "><span data-time="1363115192" class="timestamp"><p>We continued on, heading west from the Rathaus to the wall. The shops and homes inside the old city are painted in colorful yet muted hues, with plaster faces and steep tile roofs. The city wall is made of stone, and it has maybe 10 or so gates, topped with towers, for access to the outside world. We briefly left the city through and eastern gate and took in views of the valley and Tauber river way below. Here we also saw some of our first vines in Germany. (I had been expecting to have seen vineyards already on this trip.)</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363116310" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-p_O9Dv_pW0U/VhggnlZ-GkI/AAAAAAAAIGo/j1ff8ZdpULM/s288/P1400949.JPG" alt="20130312192510, "><span data-time="1363116310" class="timestamp"><p>Back in the old city, we made a brief stop in a bakery to try a local treat called schneeballen. These baked goods appear in many shop windows and are snowball sized fried dough with many folds. We tried a cinnamon and a chocolate mini-schneeballen. The fried dough is served cold and crunchy, and has a bit of the taste of a cannoli shell. I think I preferred the chocolate version.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363116879" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Ps4PuOYqCsk/VhggsJlPRUI/AAAAAAAAIHM/j6vR8-g1Q5E/s288/P1400955.JPG" alt="20130312193439, "><span data-time="1363116879" class="timestamp"><p>We looped around the southern part of the city following the wall, and then started looking for an Italian restaurant called Michelangelo as our lunch destination. On the way we passed four schoolboys who were loudly practicing their English in the street. One was yelling, "I am angry. I am crazy. I am happy!" We found this quite funny.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363119291" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-4h9GPfPl8nk/Vhgg7kEVb-I/AAAAAAAAIJc/VQ9FnCwTi7M/s288/P1400981.JPG" alt="20130312201451, "><span data-time="1363119291" class="timestamp"><p>Michelangelo's food was fine but not great. Apparently being closer to Italy does not ensure better quality food. I enjoyed the fact that the restaurant had a TV playing video of a wood fire on the wall.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363121429" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Jm5wx1gg_w0/ViF5Lf3xtNI/AAAAAAAAKyI/rVjQM8rfmuE/s288/IMG_8908.JPG" alt="20130312205029, "><span data-time="1363121429" class="timestamp"><p>We bought a few postcards, then headed back to the car. Katrina's grandmother, aunt and uncle had actually lived in a displaced persons camp in Rothenberg after WWII, so we went looking for the location of the camp. Katrina's internet research suggested that the camp is now a retreat and spa location on the Tauber, just below the city walls. We drove up and down their driveway, but did not do any further investigation.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363124386" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7qHtejady4g/ViF5LSVUlLI/AAAAAAAAKyI/H0BS3s8QGXI/s288/IMG_8914.JPG" alt="20130312213946, "><span data-time="1363124386" class="timestamp"><p>At about 2:30pm, we headed north on the Autobahn to Wurzburg. It had been snowing all through the afternoon, and the snow had begun accumulating on the ground. All of the countryside was white, and the roads were turning white too. We considered heading straight for Bamberg to avoid being caught in the storm, but I thought that if we continued to Wurzburg as planned that would perhaps give the snowplows a chance to clear the roads and make our trip home easier. By the time we pulled of the autobahn at Wurzburg, the snow coverage was enough to cause slippage and concern on the off ramps and secondary roads.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363126571" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-WtuKIt3H26k/VhghANeqieI/AAAAAAAAIKI/C7YY6cske-k/s288/P1400990.JPG" alt="20130312221611, "><span data-time="1363126571" class="timestamp"><p>At about 4:15pm, we tenderly arrived at the parkplaz at the Residenz Wurzburg. The Residenz is was palace of the Bishop-Princes of the Bavarian royal family. We belatedly joined an English tour of the palace, which took us through the main entry halls and reception rooms of the palace. The rooms had been painted with frescos by an Italian painter Tiepolo during the 1700's, and are vibrantly colorful and playful. The ceiling frescos mixed stucco sculpture in a fun way, so that when a painted figure dangled a leg out of the ceiling mural frame that leg was then modeled in 3D stucco and actually extended into the room. Similarly, the painted curtains framing the scenes on the ends of the room were also done in extruded stucco sculpture.</p><p>The colorful painting was accented by lots of gold leaf. The gold was taken to an extreme in the mirror room. This room was mirrored walls and ceilings. Some of the mirror glass had painted on the reflective foil exotic scenes from the far east and from India. Gold leaf framed all surfaces.</p><p>The Residenz was actually bombed during WWII, and only its central core was left undestroyed. The rooms on the wings (including the mirror room) are reconstructions which were done in the1960s-1980s.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363130212" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-sP2c_C9gqdw/VhghR6ImNAI/AAAAAAAAIMg/2S-LAc3ySpo/s288/P1410016.JPG" alt="20130312231652, "><span data-time="1363130212" class="timestamp"><p>After the tour ended, we viewed a few more rooms - including a green themed room which a beautiful inlaid and patterned floor - and then left the main building. We checked out attached chapel and were awed by its (literal) richness and vibrancy. So much gold leaf and bright fresco painting! I like these super punchy churches and chapels. This opulent style is one I have seen in Italy and Russia on prior vacations.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363131096" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-6wjspZMmHRg/VhghZY6GY_I/AAAAAAAAINg/N2BMm0W_XbM/s288/P1410025.JPG" alt="20130312233136, "><span data-time="1363131096" class="timestamp"><p>Having enjoyed the Residenz, we took a walk through the palace grounds and then into the city center. Wurzburg is a largely reconstructed city (post WWII), and now is a vibrant and exciting place with many students out and about. We walked to the river and looked across at the Wurzburg fortress, and out at the vine covered hills all around.</p><p>The snow was still falling fast, so we decided it was best to cancel our plans to meet Ethan and Megan for dinner in Dittelbrunn and instead to drive back to Bamberg while there was still light in the sky. Thus, we departed the Residenz Parkplatz (I turned off the stability control and did a little side for fun as we left) and took a northerly autobahn route on the A70 to Bamberg as the BMW reported that there was an accident clogging the A3.</p><p>The drive was harrowing to say the least. The snow fell steadily throughout the whole trip, and the snowplows were few and far between. While I had praised the 320d's summer tires yesterday, today they were a curse. On the city streets I had to tenderly tiptoe through the snowy slurry covering the road; on the autobahn I parked it in the right-hand lane behind the trucks, as the weight of the trucks at least cleared two strips of black pavement for me to employ.</p><p>The BMW navigation (which has proven to be a helpful thing!) notified us that there was an accident somewhere past Eltmann, and suggested we take a b-road to avoid the traffic jam. We followed its advice and ended up on completely white roads tracing the southern bank of the Main river. All was well until I came to the final roundabout which was to send us north across the river and back to the A70. As I slowly circulated its tight circumference, the car lost grip at the front wheels and started plowing towards the curb. I was not able to regain control in time, and all I could do was straighten the wheel as we jumped the (mercifully small!) curb and clobbered an innocent shrubbery. As we were stuck in shock, straddling the shrub, traffic continued to circulate behind me. We backed out, then found a pullout and I inspected the car. Beyond a twig wedged under the front bumper, all appeared OK, so we continued on.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363141563" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Rc-sVdGVJuU/Vhgh6k_ddmI/AAAAAAAAISM/eINoC_2DpJM/s288/P1410075.JPG" alt="20130313022603, "><span data-time="1363141563" class="timestamp"><p>We stuck to the main highways as much as possible, then did a nail-biting transit of Bamberg and victoriously arrived home.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363146559" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Ts_-qNSjeuQ/ViFjQUZjHII/AAAAAAAAKOQ/FFLqztpygN4/s288/IMG_20130312_154919.jpg" alt="20130313034919, "><span data-time="1363146559" class="timestamp"><p>For dinner we walked into town to Bolero for tapas, which were fine. We then took the bus home and relaxed. Some time around 11pm Ethan and Megan returned home, after their long workdays.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363149518" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-z78moXqYAIk/ViFjQXQzLqI/AAAAAAAAKOI/2_FFUFm4hM0/s288/IMG_20130312_163838.jpg" alt="20130313043838, "><span data-time="1363149518" class="timestamp"><p id="endOfEntry">&lt;End of Journal&gt;</p></span>

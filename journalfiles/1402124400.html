We slept until 7:30am, had hotel breakfast around 8am - the food here is not nearly as good as the Cross Hotel's was, but we found the usual waffles, eggs and yogurt to eat - and then returned to our room to catch up on journals and reading.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402163948" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-o7fjir8ECgY/Vky2wFTa38I/AAAAAAAAfcw/D0l67-PYqqk/s288/P1490798.JPG" alt="20140607175908, "><span data-time="1402163948" class="timestamp"><p>At about 10:45am we left the room and took the loop bus down to the Ohmicho Market to see what it is like in the morning. We were expecting it to be only a fish market, but were happily surprised to see an equal number of sellers had fruit, vegetables or dry goods for sale. The fruit and vegetable selection was quite good, and so we purchased some carrots and some cherry tomatoes for a later snack. The most interesting (and depressing) thing we saw were the super large crabs that were about 16" across including legs. The fishmongers had the crabs in boxes of ice, belly up. Most of the crabs were already dead, but there were still a few which were breathing.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402165648" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-QItw2GRdqVI/Vky2wH6WsiI/AAAAAAAAfcw/xcH9RuHohjg/s288/P1490803.JPG" alt="20140607182728, "><span data-time="1402165648" class="timestamp"><p>From the market we walked into the Kanazawa Castle Park. This is the historic site of the castle but only the original walls remain. The castle that we saw today was reconstructed very recently. We went into one of the rooms on top of the gates and the room still smelled of freshly cut wood.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402166058" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-URBEL3C6igI/Vky2wKH4YYI/AAAAAAAAfV8/uXivUzLtItA/s288/IMG_4650.JPG" alt="20140607183418, "><span data-time="1402166058" class="timestamp"><p>In the park there were fair stands with food and information. We skipped most of these and spent a little time watching a dragon dance going on in the courtyard. We then stopped in the Info Center for maps and schedules.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402168778" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_bEuQbWGGiQ/Vky2wKNmOAI/AAAAAAAAfcs/8soX8P9W_II/s288/P1490817.JPG" alt="20140607191938, "><span data-time="1402168778" class="timestamp"><p>From the castle park we walked east. Just outside of the park (before Hikoso Ohdohn Ave) there was a long line of carnival food stands. We walked a portion of the stands to see what was for sale and found dipped bananas, ice cream, fruit, onomiyaki, skewers, and candy apples. We also found fried yams, which we bought and ate at the steps of the Oyama Jinja Shrine. Japanese have a custom of not walking and eating, and so there were many Japanese sitting on the steps with fair food too.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402170826" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-bppzjvy6z5w/Vky2wFaxauI/AAAAAAAAfV8/2BYedBJy0QE/s288/IMG_4655.JPG" alt="20140607195346, "><span data-time="1402170826" class="timestamp"><p>We then continued east into the Nagamachi Bukeyashiki District, which is a district cut by a few canals and characterized by the walls of old samurai houses. Several of the old houses still exist, though most of them are privately owned or are now pottery shops. We walked around the yard of one house and then entered another which had pottery for sale. Finally, we came to Nomora samurai house which is now a museum.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402172607" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-gs2RUpNOmuo/Vky2wAgfzNI/AAAAAAAAfV8/YxuYyRhm18s/s288/IMG_4666.JPG" alt="20140607202327, "><span data-time="1402172607" class="timestamp"><p>The Nomora house might just be the most beautiful house I have ever toured. The house is defined by a small, but stunningly beautiful garden, which has layers of streams, ponds, and waterfalls crossed by stone bridges. The dry landscaping includes many twisting trees, stone pagodas, and rock scapes. It is a very dense view to overlook, but a very peaceful and captivating one none the less. Most rooms of the Nomora house look upon the garden. The stark simplicity of the traditional Japanese rooms with their tatami mat floors, painted screen walls and wood beams, contrasts with the complexity of the garden and draws your eyes outside. I enjoyed sitting in the four main rooms (two on the first level and two on the second) and gazing at the garden from different vantage points.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402174625" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-tJ0JsKhT_PE/Vky2wIk8WMI/AAAAAAAAfcU/0TU18DKZM1c/s288/P1490878.JPG" alt="20140607205705, "><span data-time="1402174625" class="timestamp"><p>The other item of interest in the house was a collection of thank you letters from employers of the samurai. The first letter was this:</p><p>"This time we won the fight owing to your hard work. We are worried about the wounds and scars you received. How are you now? Have a good rest and take care. We should have sent you a thank you letter sooner. We have been very busy these days, feeling sorry about such a simple letter like this."</p><p>The second letter was even funnier, and was from an employer who really felt like the samurai had helped him get ahead of his rival.</p><p>"We appreciate that you worked so hard to kill one high ranked soldier on the fourth of last month at the Yokokitaguchi Battle in Kaganokum Enumagun. We are very happy you brought us his head."</p><p>Wow!</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402176725" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-dxMYQBd2MAY/Vky2wL5gVvI/AAAAAAAAfcU/jHras-f9rfE/s288/P1490886.JPG" alt="20140607213205, "><span data-time="1402176725" class="timestamp"><p>After the museum we walked to the intersection of Hikoso Ohdohn Ave and Ishikawa-ken to watch the parade. We sat on a wall by a sculpture of running legs and people watched until the parade made it to our location. With a little looking it is still possible to find nonsensical English phrases on Japanese clothing and bags. I was also amused at how many people wear clothing with the names of American and specifically Californian cities.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402178953" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-BaJz8mioFR4/Vky2wAYjECI/AAAAAAAAfcU/NMEe60i2ifk/s288/P1490891.JPG" alt="20140607220913, "><span data-time="1402178953" class="timestamp"><p>The parade lasted quite some time. First we had numerous marching bands and baton twirling groups pass by. Most of these groups were actually composed of Japanese school children. Then we had groups in traditional Japanese dress parade by. A few dragons were in this section of the parade, and they ran from side to side of the street snapping at onlookers. All of the dragons felt it necessary to snap at the commentator who was narrating our corner of the parade.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402181178" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-uZl3mtjSWvs/Vky2wBK776I/AAAAAAAAfV8/S0XFUwMeFWk/s288/IMG_4695.JPG" alt="20140607224618, "><span data-time="1402181178" class="timestamp"><p>Also in this section were the troupes of ladder acrobats. There were about ten of these troupes, each with a 15" ladder. The ladder was held upright erect by eight or so men with hooked pools. Then the acrobat climbed to the top of the ladder and did balancing poses on its top.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402184188" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-WcvvuG6qLdA/Vky2wLE8fgI/AAAAAAAAfcM/NDukHHGj0vc/s288/P1490934.JPG" alt="20140607233628, "><span data-time="1402184188" class="timestamp"><p>Toward the end of the parade were legions of samurai warriors headed to the castle. Kanazawa hires a famous actress and actor to take part in the parade too each year. We stayed until the actor was brought by on a horse.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402188149" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-c9Eugh44G9w/Vky2wLhgRjI/AAAAAAAAfcM/fhsYtTSVpZE/s288/P1490951.JPG" alt="20140608004229, "><span data-time="1402188149" class="timestamp"><p>After leaving the parade we searched Katamachi neighborhood to find Osteria del Campagna for an early dinner. While we did eventually find the restaurant, the were all booked up and would not seat us. We looked into a few other restaurants, but ultimately returned to the fair food where we bought grilled corn and onomiyaki (hold the meat!). Still hungry but not finding any of the other fair food appealing, we found a veggie sushi box at a Circle-K convenience store.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402189434" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-b01P5P3cJYk/Vky2wNdkYTI/AAAAAAAAfV8/tLxidfes6Gg/s288/IMG_4713.JPG" alt="20140608010354, "><span data-time="1402189434" class="timestamp"><p>We ate our veggie sushi on the curb of the main shopping street in Kohrinbo and watched the dance party on the street. When I heard there was a dance party as part of the weekend festivities I had imaged more like a concert with people dancing like they might in a club. Instead, the dance party here was to more traditional music with everyone in an organization (a bank, insurance company, coffee shop, etc.) all dancing together in identical garb to a line dance that everyone in the city knows. To put it another way, imagine that all the companies in town handed out identical uniforms and told their employees to come to the dance. Then, they lined up in rectangular formations and all the companies danced the exact same dances simultaneously in a parade. It sounds a little boring, but actually it was quite fun to watch while we ate.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402192693" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-etZf7zkW_UQ/Vky2wHfklzI/AAAAAAAAfV8/5VWRdQOcWUI/s288/IMG_4720.JPG" alt="20140608015813, "><span data-time="1402192693" class="timestamp"><p>After dinner we walked back to the Kanazawa castle to see if anything exciting was going on there. The crowd had emptied out and there was a small group of people watching a Noh play - a style of play where tradition is valued over creativity. We watched for a few minutes but since we could not understand the chanting and the main actor was doing a slow arhythmic dance we did not stay interested.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402193501" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-WNnDC6aZpTY/Vky2wEP8JCI/AAAAAAAAfcI/kqZxixnPDrQ/s288/P1490968.JPG" alt="20140608021141, "><span data-time="1402193501" class="timestamp"><p>We walked back to the hotel and retired. Katrina used the onsen (her hip has been hurting) and I washed some clothes in the sink, showered, and wrote this journal entry.</p><p id="endOfEntry">&lt;End of Journal&gt;</p></span>

<h2><a id="Ko Samui to BKK">Ko Samui to BKK</a></h2><h3><a id="1401346800">05/29/2014</a></h3><p>Today is our last day in South East Asia before we fly to Japan.</p><p>We got up just after sunrise (even though we were trying to sleep in!) and we got dressed for the beach before heading to breakfast. The Amari buffet was exciting as ever. I had fried eggs on toast, fruit, yogurt, pastry, cheese, and some Indian spiced potatoes. Kat was going to try the muesli but found ants in it!</p><p>We walked along the beach after breakfast. The beach was pretty much deserted at 8:30 am in the morning. As we walked south we watched the jet ski boys zip around on the water, playing before the tourists arrived. We also observed the racing yachts for the annual regatta moored in the bay.</p><p>We walked to the end of Chaweng Central beach, which is separated from Little Chaweng by a row of rocks and a resort property. My guess is that we were about 2.5 miles south of the Amari. Here we put our stuff on the beach chairs of another resort and went into the water.</p><p>The water was a little cooler this morning, since the skies were overcast. The sea floor was sandy and very gradually sloped, and we walked out until the water hit our waists. Along the way some creature scratched at the sole of my foot through the sand - I think it was a small crab which burrowed in the sea floor. Then, as we were standing out in the water, Katrina was poked in the bottom of her foot too and very shortly later felt a strong sting on the backside of her leg. Fearing for jelly fish, we got out of the water. The stinging went away shortly.</p><p>After drying in the sun and watching little crabs dig holes in the beach, we headed north up Chaweng. We stopped for one more swim, then returned to the Amari.</p><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401390617" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-JbrU1fjJNj8/VkoZovJkv_I/AAAAAAAAfJo/I3Fw7dp31JE/s288/P1480595.JPG" alt="20140529191017, "><span data-time="1401390617" class="timestamp"><p>Next we spent a little time by the pool, mostly relaxing under the beach umbrellas but doing a little swimming too. Around 12:30 pm we had had enough sun and we returned to the room to shower, pack and get ready for checkout.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401396996" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-bjueZ-fVj-c/VkoZoqQdR4I/AAAAAAAAfKc/Ds2n1cHedZQ/s288/P1480602.JPG" alt="20140529205636, "><span data-time="1401396996" class="timestamp"><p>Once we were packed we moved our bags to the front desk and then went to the bar to take advantage of the afternoon happy hour. Katrina and I shared frozen margaritas and pina coladas.</p><p>A little after 2 pm, we walked into town to find some lunch. As we have become accustomed to, we were approached by the many restaurant, massage, tailor, and taxi services along the way. The typical approach is to say hello or sawadee and then ask if you want to eat or want a taxi. The tailors on the other hand try to chat you up on your style or greet you as a friend to get you to engage and stop walking. The massage ladies are the funniest though, as there are some many of them (especially on the beaches) and they call after you with "you want maaa-saaage?" Massages here are actually really cheap. $11 can get you a one hour massage.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401398511" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_hcUCCzsnIM/VkoZoiEbA-I/AAAAAAAAfJo/L6dqQkwJOhY/s288/P1480603.JPG" alt="20140529212151, "><span data-time="1401398511" class="timestamp"><p>I had Italian in mind, but Katrina thought it a shame that we would not have more Thai food since it is our last day in Thailand. Luckily both wishes were granted. A very cleanly pad thai street food vendor was cooking on the main tourist street about a block before the Italian restaurant. Katrina ordered a bowl of pad thai which we shared. It was good pad thai, though like all pad thai it is pretty plain in flavor. I enjoyed watching the woman cook on the two woks she had in her push-cart restaurant.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401399570" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-gSGIaMaVCPs/VkoZotUuGtI/AAAAAAAAfJo/zCPRejutxIY/s288/P1480605.JPG" alt="20140529213930, "><span data-time="1401399570" class="timestamp"><p>After first lunch we had second lunch at Duomo, an Italian restaurant we had found online. The pasta sauce served with the bread was amazing, full of sweet tomatoes and rich garlic. Our bruschetta was tasty too, though I would have preferred a crunchier toast. The entree I ordered was a mushroom and olive calazone, and Katrina and I were both very impressed with the pizza crust. It was a large meal even though we only ordered one entree. We tried to pace our meal as slowly as possible so we could enjoy the AC; whenever we are outside rivers of sweat form!</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401405639" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Cbp_IUGfS8g/VkoZojFup4I/AAAAAAAAfJo/0raq6QsA8ks/s288/IMG_4130.JPG" alt="20140529232039, "><span data-time="1401405639" class="timestamp"><p>We went back to the hotel and settled our bill. I managed to spend all but 15 bhat remaining in my wallet. (The leftover bhat we donated at the airport.) We had about one hour until our ride to the airport would come, so waited by the pool and used the internet. It was in the ~80F today and humid, so I was shirt off and pants rolled up to keep from sweating while sitting still!</p><p>We had a short five minute drive to the airport. Both a local guide and a driver were sent to transfer us. It seemed a little silly as we could easily have checked ourselves in. That said, the guide did have the idea to have Bangkok Air check our bags all the way through to KIX (Osaka) so that we would not need to pick them up in BKK. Additionally, we were checked in as international travelers in Ko Samui and passed through customs, again front-loading something which I expected we would need to accomplish in BKK.</p><p>We waited in the Bangkok Air terminal, just having a small snack on their free food and drinks. Kat used the free internet; I wrote in my journal.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401412933" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-AfJ9UtQlj-o/VkoZosNFnfI/AAAAAAAAfJo/8yzR7amFTvg/s288/P1480609.JPG" alt="20140530012213, "><span data-time="1401412933" class="timestamp"><p>Our flight PG 170 left on time. The airplane was a newer A319. We had seats on the left of the plane and were able to see our beach resort just after take off and then watch the islands go by. Next we overlooked the Thai peninsula all the way to the Andaman Sea and see the sunset. It was a pretty productive 50 minute flight!</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401432971" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-i6gUE39pxNA/VkoZoql7OGI/AAAAAAAAfJ4/Sc242nDneho/s288/P1480625.JPG" alt="20140530065611, "><span data-time="1401432971" class="timestamp"><p>Once in BKK airport we had a very long walking transfer from the east wing where we had arrived to the Japan Airlines transfer desk in the west wing. Every info booth we passed along the way we asked for the wifi passcode tickets - one ticket is worth one hour of wifi use. While the first two stands wanted our passport info in exchange for the tickets, the final stand just had a little box from which you could pull as many tickets as you liked! We stocked up.</p><p>We checked in at the JAL desk and were very happy to be moved into a bulkhead row where we will have a little more legroom.</p><p>We then went to the 4th floor of the international wing of BKK, browsed the mini-mall which is on that floor, ate identical free cookie samples at four different stores (one of the stores had freeze dried durian to sample too, I still think it tastes odd) and then found a very nice and dark corner of the forth flour where people have turned low couches into beds. Here we caught up on our journals, charged our phones, and rested.</p><p id="endOfEntry">&lt;End of Journal&gt;</p></span>

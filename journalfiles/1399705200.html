I think I too was up multiple times.</p><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399724409" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-nnvcSA24nW4/U_dKVMfX8zI/AAAAAAAADiQ/KvJq42ULX6I/s288/P1460600.JPG" alt="20140510122009, "><span data-time="1399724409" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399724409" class="timestamp"><p>We got up officially at 5am when Mingma knocked on our door to raise us. We quickly dressed and headed out of the hotel, passed the mule train station, and then back to the helipad to watch the sunrise. It had not rained yesterday and maybe for that reason the air was a little hazy in the morning. The sun came up to the right of Fish Tail mountain and lit Annapurna 1 first. The Ghandruk monastery was playing a recorded chant over loud speakers and when the sun crested the horizon they played the drums for a few minutes. (I had to run back to the hotel in the middle of the sunrise to use the toilet, but I returned before it was complete.)</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399729340" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-P682J-H0bu0/U_dKgflzMoI/AAAAAAAADkU/86RE-Xcz4hI/s288/P1460617.JPG" alt="20140510134220, "><span data-time="1399729340" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399729340" class="timestamp"><p>We had Tilak move up our breakfast time to 6:30. Katrina and I both had "Breakfast B" which included two eggs, toast, muesli, and potatoes.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399732930" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-sD89ARyVse8/U_dKjquPtqI/AAAAAAAADk0/JVqsNgkyk5k/s288/P1460621.JPG" alt="20140510144210, "><span data-time="1399732930" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399732930" class="timestamp"><p>We hit the path around 7:40am and began our descent out of the mountains. The first part of our journey was down long staircases which stunk of mule dung and urine. At least the views were nice, looking into the river valley below and back up at the snow mountains behind. Along the way we picked up two trailers; dogs that would follow us most of the way back to Birethani. Tilak says that these dogs will follow you to your lunch spot, and then beg for food.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399736363" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-4B3LcgeU1CI/U_dKrTKj-oI/AAAAAAAADmY/74E99U7Jpdw/s288/P1460635.JPG" alt="20140510153923, "><span data-time="1399736363" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399736363" class="timestamp"><p>It took about one hour to make it down to the start of the jeep road. Here, multiple jeeps were lined up to take people back to Pokhara. The bus line also ended here and there were two buses also ready to return to Pokhara. I wondered if it was worth us doing the long walk back to Nayapol or if the tour would be better if it ended here with a jeep ride out. (I later decided that I would take the jeep ride out to have more time at higher elevation.)</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399736548" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7yoooAhqIFs/U_bXamCnFuI/AAAAAAAAB8M/qotWZ92flIU/s288/IMG_3232.JPG" alt="20140510154228, "><span data-time="1399736548" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399736548" class="timestamp"><p>What followed for our walk were many more stairs descending the layers and layers of terraced farmland. The most prevalent crop was corn, but we also saw people drying rice on tarps and in woven baskets. This layer of farm land was interesting as the farm houses are all sturdy traditional houses with two stories. The first story is a larger rectangle, the second story a smaller rectangle on top of the first. They appear to be build of stone and are often painted white. Many children were out in the yards or fields (there is no school on Saturday) and we even passed a few families washing in the communal spigots which dot the trails in this region. The young children here wash completely naked; the women wash while wrapped in saris.</p><p>While it was interesting to see a bit of farming life, these farms are not as pretty as the ones higher up the mountains. In fact, the further we descended the rougher the farms became and the more trash there was to be found on the paths and in the gullies. Tilak must have been disappointed with the trash all over the paths too, as he started collecting it as we walked. He blamed it on the school children, but I think the problem is larger than that.</p><p>We took at tea break halfway down the staircases, but since it was so hot and humid no one actually had tea. We looked at some nice souvenirs that were for sale, but since we cannot bear the thought of carrying extra weight for four more weeks we passed on buying anything.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399740694" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-lhiarei0QaM/U_dKyWfCKvI/AAAAAAAADno/_aHGu5hSu0Y/s288/P1460648.JPG" alt="20140510165134, "><span data-time="1399740694" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399740694" class="timestamp"><p>After another 30 minutes of staircases we took another short break. It was not much longer until the staircases ended close to the river banks and we started walking the dirt road to Nayapol. Tilak had told us that we might be able to go swimming at a tall waterfall along the walk, but when we got to the waterfall just a trickle of water was falling into a scummy pool. We continued on.</p><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399744086" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-t5P-Z2kQcK8/U_dK2BnMlHI/AAAAAAAADog/q57NobloGwA/s288/P1460655.JPG" alt="20140510174806, "><p>We took one additional break along the road. I had a Bounty coconut-filled candy bar here. This stop was the first tea house with a refrigerator we had encountered on our hike. The hottest part of the day and walk came afterwards. I am not sure how hot it was exactly, but I guess it was in the 80F's range.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399747559" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-eAjAhhkHFWg/U_dK4rVBdLI/AAAAAAAADo0/yuQyzTTmaUQ/s288/P1460659.JPG" alt="20140510184559, "><span data-time="1399747559" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399747559" class="timestamp"><p>At last our Annapurna loop was completed when we made it back to Birethani. Here we took lunch. Since it was our last chance, Katrina and I both had dal bhat, and we had seconds on the potato and green bean curry. I also had a mango lassi and about 0.75 liters of cold water. (Since we were back in refrigeration territory I took advantage of having cold drinks.)</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399751502" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-e5SHw5EpaAo/U_dLBMnRTwI/AAAAAAAADp4/xOajSSAEF9o/s288/P1460670.JPG" alt="20140510195142, "><span data-time="1399751502" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399751502" class="timestamp"><p>We walked the last 30 minutes to Nayapol, retracing the route we did four days ago. The cleanly beauty of the alpine towns was gone, back was the ramshackle construction and disregard for trash collection. Welcome back gritty Nepal!</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399752837" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-rju-DFUxsBY/U_dLClu5v7I/AAAAAAAAbBE/7Fuwo-P59cY/s288/P1460672.JPG" alt="20140510201357, "><span data-time="1399752837" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399752837" class="timestamp"><p>We also passed quite a few children eating ice cream. Kat and I had been pining for ice cream for the last two days (ever since we descended into lower elevations with hot weather again) so we each got cones. In our paranoid manner, we just ate the ice cream off the top of the cone instead of risking eating the cone which had been handled by the grungy fingered lady behind the shop counter. Are we crazy?</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399755847" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-B-ihZ9BUww8/U_dLDG8z3oI/AAAAAAAAa-U/Sgqni88icjU/s288/P1460673.JPG" alt="20140510210407, "><span data-time="1399755847" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399755847" class="timestamp"><p>We met our van driver at the same restaurant/store where we had been originally dropped off. This time we had a large Toyota passenger van rather than the smaller Land Cruiser. The guides and porters all piled in the van with us for the ride back to Pokhara. This driver was super careful about taking bumps slowly and not harming his vehicle. I also got a better sense for the road rules during this drive. In most places the road is two lanes wide but only paved for about one lane's width in the center of the road. Thus, cars going in both directions drive in the center of the road. They more or less play chicken until they are about to hit each and then they dive to the dirt/rock/pothole side of the road so that they can pass without hitting.</p><p>Along the way (just as has been true during our hiking today) we saw lots of children out and about. Tilak tells me that the schedule for school children (and also for workers) is that Friday is a half-day and Saturday is the one day of rest. Being Saturday, we are seeing the kids on their day off. The kids were collecting little orange berries the size of raspberries and the hawking cups of them to passing tourist cars.</p><p>Along the way back to Pokhara Tilak and Katrina both were nodding off.</p><p>As we left the Annapurna region, crossed up and over the mountains and back down into Pokhara's valley, the smog in the air thickened. I could feel my breathing being impaired and Sally started coughing in the back seat. Nepal is beautiful up high in the mountains, but it sure is trying in the cities.</p><p>Once we got back into Pokhara valley there were many people walking the road in their Sunday best. Tilak thought they might be Christians headed to church.</p><p>We reentered the mess which is Pokhara - dirt ditches where sidewalks or yards would be in other countries, rivers full of trash, trucks and buses vying with motorcycles for road space, honking and diesel fumes. We dropped off our strong porter, and then continued on to our hotel.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399759089" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-d4PGBRnCVo8/U_dLFNOtn8I/AAAAAAAADzg/-dM95Wa-_g4/s288/P1460679.JPG" alt="20140510215809, "><span data-time="1399759089" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399759089" class="timestamp"><p>The Hotel Barahi is quite grand from the outside. with beautifully manicured grounds, a pretty swimming pool, and buildings which look like they could be luxury condos. Our room was nice and spacious too, but the details were all wrong. The carpet and sheets were stained, the toilet paper roll dispenser broken, the toilet smelled, the bathroom window opened into a hallway with traffic, and yet people could look into the bathroom. Then when I washed my clothes in the sink (the water was dirty through three rinses!) the draining water overflowed the pipe and spilled out onto the bathroom floor. Katrina had us moved to another room, which had most of the problems resolved, although the sheets are still stained, the desk chair was broken and some of the windows don't close. We had the sheets changed. Also, just like in Kathmandu, the mattresses are terrible!</p></span><span data-time="1399759095" class="timestamp"><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399770257" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-BH13oFlICGE/VjeZI7crxVI/AAAAAAAAemM/F7Go6RayE6U/s288/IMG_20140510_180417.jpg" alt="20140511010417, "><p>We meet with our trek mates, Tilak and with John (Marylin is still bed bound) and went out for dinner at Moonshine Restaurant, which is just a block away from us. The short walk between the hotel and restaurant is actually rather nice, in a touristy lake-side neighborhood where the grit of the city is out of sight. The restaurant has Canadian owner says the menu, and the place is beautiful, slightly swanky, two story space with loft dining overhead and open air to the street. We sat upstairs in the loft area. I enjoyed the veggie korma and pad thai dishes we ordered, we shared another bottle of wine with Trevor and Sally, and we tried their world famous lemon meringue pie which was really the best pie of that type I've had.</p><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399774365" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-jY4NpSvNyT0/VjeZI34WjPI/AAAAAAAAemQ/FvUeZO1Mruw/s288/IMG_20140510_191245.jpg" alt="20140511021245, "><p>John and Marylin are headed to the American West as their next step in their journey, so we talked about where they are going and what they will see. Katrina and I recommended they find the Boiling River in Yellowstone.</p><p>We returned to the hotel afterwards to sleep.</p><p id="endOfEntry">&lt;End of Journal&gt;</p></span></span>

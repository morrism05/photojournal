<h2><a id="Ko Samui">Ko Samui</a></h2><h3><a id="1401174000">05/27/2014</a></h3><p>We woke up this morning from a good sleep. The pillows here at Al's Laemson Resort are softer and thinner than most of the pillows we had over the prior week, and so I was able to sleep better.</p><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401203496" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-duznPX6p_IA/VkoZopBwoJI/AAAAAAAAfMA/f7rln8V5cQ4/s288/P1480452.JPG" alt="20140527151136, "><span data-time="1401203496" class="timestamp"><p>It was nearly 8 am when we left the room for breakfast. The breakfast restaurant is down near the beach. They had the typical options of eggs, bread, salad makings, some Japanese soup, fruit and yogurt. I had my typical breakfast of omelet, fruit, yogurt and muesli.</p><p>Even as breakfast was ending we were sweltering in the sun. It had rained last night but whatever cool that brought was now gone.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401204363" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-RLd9dcf4Sjc/VkoZosc7-aI/AAAAAAAAfMA/PU7hq1PfAxU/s288/P1480454.JPG" alt="20140527152603, "><span data-time="1401204363" class="timestamp"><p>We walked north along the beach, Katrina was combing the sand for sea shells. The tide was lower than we saw it yesterday, and she managed to find a few shells. Most of the other resorts on this north stretch of beach are nicer than Al's, but they all seemed very quiet with few guests. The beach here is not covered in trash (which is something the guide from yesterday warned about) but it is covered in coral bits which are sharp to the feet.</p><p>We walked back south, past the hotel to the point which looks down Chaweng beach. Today there was sand exposed where water was prior, and we could have walked the beach into town if we wanted. The water was not so low that we could have walked to the island.</p><p>We returned to the hotel room and changed into bathing suits, then got in the hotel pool. We were only in the pool for a few minutes, because some very ominous clouds were forming and the rumble of thunder could be heard. Not wanting to move hotels in a deluge of rain, we dried off and went back to the room to pack up.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401210781" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-TeypG4r6Uxk/VkoZopqlZUI/AAAAAAAAfL4/8R7SVvJWnYQ/s288/P1480466.JPG" alt="20140527171301, "><span data-time="1401210781" class="timestamp"><p>We checked out of Al's Laemson and hiked with our packs to the Amari Palm Reef hotel. We actually discovered that across the street from Al's reception we could sneak through another hotel to get the the northernmost end of Chaweng beach, so we walked all the way to Amari on Chaweng. This was much nicer than walking along the road.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401212096" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-x37fVNuyZR8/VkoZopYmzOI/AAAAAAAAfL4/DTLPBdEk2sc/s288/P1480471.JPG" alt="20140527173456, "><span data-time="1401212096" class="timestamp"><p>Amari had us wait for ten or fifteen minutes while our room was made up. We got a room on the inland side of the property, across the main road. (The hotel actually has crossing guards to help guests cross from one side to the other. We have a view over the back pool and are in a spacious second floor room of a two room hut. Everything is so clean and luxurious! We have a nice soft comforter, mattresses which coddle their sleeper instead of resisting him, a shiny clean bathroom with generously thick bars of soap and fluffy towels. Oh what an extra $60/night gives.</p><p>Since the thick thunderclouds were still nearby but no rain had started, we put on our suits again and went across the street to access the beach. Along the way we walked through the ocean-side Amari resort, which has they resort-typical upscale gardening with water channels running along the pathways and water lilies brightening the view. The beach at Amari is soft white sand and there is a coconut palm grove against the property which shades the beach chairs.</p><p>We got in the water and found it to be rather warm. In fact, we have had showers on this trip which could not produce such warm water! The shore around the hotel is very shallow, so Katrina and I went for a walk in the Gulf of Thailand. We walked maybe 200 meters out to a flag on a buoy, and then I could not resist walking out to a nearby dinghy which was anchored in the bay. The water must have been 3' at its deepest.</p><p>While very pleasant, this portion of the beach was not the best beach Katrina and I had ever seen by a long shot; Trunk Beach in USVI St John has that honor, and some Hawaiian beaches are nicer too. Katrina mused about whether Thailand as a value beach proposition was invalid for US travelers who have to pay for airfares to get halfway around the world.</p><p>There were still big storm clouds overhead, but none had broken loose with rain yet. We decided to walk south on Chaweng beach to see what the more populated Central Chaweng was like. The shadow of the clouds actually made the walk much nicer that it otherwise would have been at noon.</p><p>We walked down Central Chaweng to about the Monkey Bar which we estimate to be about 1.5 miles away. Here the water is clearer and a tad bit cooler and the is sand cleaner than up at the Amari. There are also quite a few on beach bars and clubs. Many vendors were renting out jet skis too.</p><p>We floated for quite sometime near the Monkey Bar, looking up at the sky and wondering which direction the dark storm clouds would move. It turned out that they were blowing away from the island, and soon the full beach was in the sun again. Katrina did some digging in the seabed and found many tiny spiral-shelled animals and also a live sand dollar (sand baht?).</p><p>It was not too long before I was feeling as if my sunscreen was failing and I was getting burnt. We walked back to the resort, quickly dipped in the pool, then returned to our rooms and showed.</p><p>I called our local guide contact Natalie to tell her we had moved hotels. She is going to tell our snorkeling trip and our airport ride about our new location. She also advised us about the military curfew, but noted that there are no military on Ko Samui and that the police don't seem interested in enforcing this rule. Regardless most of the businesses are closing by 10pm.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401228501" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-mzrqj3dbI9k/VkoZonSMWbI/AAAAAAAAfLw/tmj8lHl2rlA/s288/P1480479.JPG" alt="20140527220821, "><span data-time="1401228501" class="timestamp"><p>We were hungry for lunch at this point, so we put on our sandals and walked two blocks into town to Khow Glong Thai restaurant. Katrina had read nice reviews about this place, and even some reviews which said they would could their curries with the spiciness appropriate to southern Thai cooking. Excitedly we ordered a red curry at heat level 3 "Thai Spicy" and a green curry at heat level 2 "Medium". The red curry arrived drier than I was expecting, and it was indeed spicy but hardly the spiciest curry I have had (thank you Jackson Hole, WY). The chili flavor was one of the predominant flavors but I still get all of the other flavors too. The green curry was more in the typical liquidity of coconut soup based curries. This turned out to be the tastier of the two. It had Thai eggplants, tofu and mushrooms, and was oh-so-yummy. Probably the best Thai curry of the trip.</p><p>We came back to the hotel to hide from the heat of the day. I wrote in my journal, and felt the heat on my shoulders and upper torso building. I have sunburnt myself.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401236237" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-zyqx80tLuo0/VkoZoqKME5I/AAAAAAAAfLw/YTRY5H2ga4M/s288/P1480483.JPG" alt="20140528001717, "><span data-time="1401236237" class="timestamp"><p>Around 5 pm we went down to the oceanside pool. I hid in the shade with my phone and long sleeve shirt as Katrina did some reading and then went for a swim. Happy hour started at 6 pm and Katrina ordered a Mai Tai and I ordered a fizzy lime drink that tasted of refreshing limeade. We watched the sunset; from our east facing beach we got the colors of the clouds reflected in the still waters of the bay.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401243591" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-AuulBGXjLc0/VkoZohkG1mI/AAAAAAAAfJo/-ztlzSzd_TY/s288/IMG_20140527_191951.jpg" alt="20140528021951, "><span data-time="1401243591" class="timestamp"><p>After returning to the room shortly to let Katrina get into dinner clothes, we walked south on Chaweng. Many of the restaurants had set out tables on the dwindling beach (we were approaching high tide), some running buffets and others offering large seafood displays. Also strolling the beach were vendors selling laser light guns (every time we approached one of these vendors, the sand would start dancing with green stars) or selling paper lanterns which are lit and then sent up into the sky like a hot air balloon. We also had our own light show of stars to the east and lightning to the south and west.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401245574" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-UMd8XykWX0M/VkoZosPLT-I/AAAAAAAAfJo/fA9iajB12nU/s288/IMG_20140527_195254.jpg" alt="20140528025254, "><span data-time="1401245574" class="timestamp"><p>We walked the beach until the Malibu hotel and bar, then cut through their yard to get to the street. This put us out at a new, flashy open air mall. The street was busy with taxis and mopeds going by (in one direction on the one way street). We walked south about one block to Noori Indian restaurant. The okra and garlic naan were very good here, but the baigan bharta (eggplant) was fabulous! It is perhaps the best preparation of the dish I have tried. The owner of Noori was present in the restaurant tonight, and he mentioned to Katrina how the tourist traffic is getting lower with each passing day in post-coup Thailand. He suggested it was getting hard to justify paying all of his employees. We have noticed that many bars and restaurants have more employees than customers.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401247719" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-aIgsa3DIe5A/VkoZosdeF0I/AAAAAAAAfJo/N9h1fO4O8ow/s288/IMG_20140527_202839.jpg" alt="20140528032839, "><span data-time="1401247719" class="timestamp"><p>We walked home via the beach too, passing several nightclubs with DJs spinning tunes to empty dance floors. We wonder if they will close the club before curfew.</p><p id="endOfEntry">&lt;End of Journal&gt;</p></span>

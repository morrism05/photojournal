We went to the breakfast in the hotel restaurant then went back to the room to do some packing in preparation for our trek tomorrow.</p><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399306778" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-WRcvC-B_jkw/U_dEE3yIgAI/AAAAAAAACkg/DFnW67k-pUg/s288/P1450839.JPG" alt="20140505161938, "><span data-time="1399306778" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399306778" class="timestamp"><p>At 9am Tilak met our tour group in the lobby to introduce us to Utara, our city tour guide. Shortly later we all boarded a bus and headed for Kathmandu's most sacred Hindu temple Pashupatinath. Along the way Utara told us a little about Kathmandu. We learned that the walled compound we had been walking past on the way to Thali was the old king's palace, and it now is government owned. We also learned that Kathmandu has quadrupled in size in the last few decades, and the government is trying to expand its roads to handle all the new traffic. The issue they face is that they do not have the money to compensate all of the building owners of buildings that line the roads to be expanded. This has led to protests and slow progress in their construction goals.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399307822" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-6elmk3fk56g/U_bH-_00VOI/AAAAAAAAArQ/UL6x5DL4k4k/s288/IMG_2553.JPG" alt="20140505163702, "><span data-time="1399307822" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399307822" class="timestamp"><p>We eventually made it to the temple complex and followed Utara in through the gates. This site is along Nepal's most sacred river the Bagmati; the river where where many Hindu's bring their dead for funerary cremation. We very soon came to the river, and across the water were multiple funeral parties building wood pyres or actively burning/cremating their deceased. We were told that Hindu funerals are usually held the very next day after a person's death.</p><p>As non-believers, we were not allowed to cross the river and enter the interior of the temple complex. Thus, we watched from our bank what we could see from the outside. Most interesting for us was seeing the many monkeys climbing on the temple walls and pestering people for food. Other animals on the site included a few cows and lots and lots of stray dogs. Also on our bank were small temple structures with lingum sculptures inside which people were using as the places of prayer.</p><p>Utara collected a pool of money from all the tourists that wanted to take pictures of the Sadus - Hindu hermits with bright painted faces that hang out all day long and smoke hasheesh. Katrina and I didn't contribute to the pool.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399311980" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-omaZFErZV_M/U_bI02KfbEI/AAAAAAAAAv0/Kx4sZ8Mf0Hk/s288/IMG_2589.JPG" alt="20140505174620, "><span data-time="1399311980" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399311980" class="timestamp"><p>After maybe 1 hour we left Pashupatinath and reboarded the bus for Boudhanath, stupa the most sacred Buddhist site in Kathmandu. This temple is a large round structure with the all-knowing eyes face panted on a tower in its center. It was originally built in the 5th century, but has been continually updated/maintained. Today, there were workers painting the whites of the eyes, flying new banners from the tower, and splashing yellow plain along on the surface of the dome trying to form lotus petals. As one does, we walked around the base of the temple in a clockwise direction and spun the prayer spindles build into the wall of the base. Each spindle contains a prayer asking for good luck, and a spin of the spindle is akin to saying that prayer yourself. Thus, walking the perimeter of the temple and spinning all the prayers is a very efficient way to build some good luck for yourself.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399312607" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vily8v91E/U_dEXCYxXnI/AAAAAAAACfM/g1ZyjQtfEos/s288/P1450877.JPG" alt="20140505175647, "><span data-time="1399312607" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399312607" class="timestamp"><p>We did enter a little temple adjacent to the stupa for a short while to look at a golden Buddha.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399312884" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-QwZqFcWxuJw/U_dEYSo1oEI/AAAAAAAACfg/XUUOiWC0Mls/s288/P1450881.JPG" alt="20140505180124, "><span data-time="1399312884" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399312884" class="timestamp"><p>We were given a little free time at the site, and I went shopping for some rain pants in the adjacent tourist shops. I found some cheapo rain pants for $8 (the zipper handle broke in two while I was trying them on!) which I hope with make our upcoming trek more comfortable. It has been raining every day and the forecast is calling for more rain soon. One thing that is very nice about the tourist vendors in Nepal is that they are very laid back, don't try to force you into their shops or accost you. When I walked away from two vendors when I was looking for pants there was no pressure to keep me in the store.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399313836" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-cs8u3KUeYKA/U_dEfFbrLgI/AAAAAAAACgg/uHjlrtgPBvM/s288/P1450893.JPG" alt="20140505181716, "><span data-time="1399313836" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399313836" class="timestamp"><p>We reboarded the bus and were brought back to our hotel by 12:30pm. Very unfortunately, I left my rain jacket in the back of the bus when I disembarked. I called the bus company from the front desk of Shangri-la Hotel, and a English speaking man who picked up the phone said he would look in the bus for the jacket when it returns.</p><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399321572" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-scrubZYShXc/VjeZI2cT2EI/AAAAAAAAemQ/EVrnPzt8mnI/s288/IMG_20140505_132612.jpg" alt="20140505202612, "><p>Katrina and I went out to lunch at Bhumi, the same restaurant from last night's dinner, and we tried our veggie momo steamed this time. Also in our order was a malai kofta curry, some daal soup and naan. It was all good and tasty again and very cheap too at just $8.</p><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399323205" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-EVlOmks2ZjM/VjeZI39OIPI/AAAAAAAAemQ/8u4E8VM1F7I/s288/IMG_20140505_135325.jpg" alt="20140505205325, "><p>We took a short trip to check out the local super market. Many products we recognized from home, and things like beauty and shaving products were 1/3 the cost here as they are in the USA.</p><p>At 4pm we met with the tour group and Tilak to receive our trip bags from Peregrine. These are the duffel bags that the porters will carry to our tea houses. We were also given a down jacket and sleeping bag for use in the tea houses at night...I guess this trip will be colder than I expected!</p><p>I told Tilak about my missing jacket and at the end of our bag packing meeting he got a call from the bus company saying that they had my raincoat. Tilak very graciously went to get my jacket and returned it to me by 5:30pm. I feel so stupid to have left it behind, and I am very thankful to have it returned.</p><p>At 6:30pm we went across the street to the Vietnamese restaurant with our trip mates. Our pho and noodles were fine, but some of the others were less happy with their meals. It was interesting to see where the others had traveled, as many of our favorite places in Europe and China were mentioned by John, Judy, Trevor, Sally, or Marilyn.</p><p>We returned to the hotel to finish packing and prepare for tomorrow's hike.</p><p id="endOfEntry">&lt;End of Journal&gt;</p></span></span>

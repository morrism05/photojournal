Immediately we departed for the Laos border. The drive was about 2 hours long and went first east and then north.</p><p>We passed through a number of villages. People were waking up, giving alms to the monks in bright orange robes (I learned that the monks bring the alms back to the temple and the food feeds them for breakfast and maybe lunch too), waiting for the school bus to arrive, etc. The farmers were heading out to the fields of rice and the orchards of rubber trees. There were also a number of morning markets where people could buy produce or even prepared foods for breakfast.</p><p>Though most of the area we drove through was flat and rice farmed, there were a few stretches of road that went over the hills and through orchards and forest.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400508757" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-VRjD5amHqSQ/VkD7hIz9FFI/AAAAAAAAfIU/wNtG7Q8HjxE/s288/P1470294.JPG" alt="20140519141237, "><span data-time="1400508757" class="timestamp"><p>The border crossing is a newly completed complex. On the Thai side there is a large facility where we met with the boat tour staff, prepared our paperwork for our Laos visas, and then had the Thai officials stamp our exit visas. We said goodbye to Nuk here. The official border is the Mekong River itself, and a new "friendship bridge" spans the water to Laos. We waited about 30 minutes for the shuttle bus to leave from the Thai side to the Laos side.</p><p>It turns out that the Lao government build an identical border facility to the Thai facility on its side of the boarder. Here we got visas on arrival (for $35 each) and met our guide "La" who will shepherd us on our river tour.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400513527" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-hKoTZPRfO0I/VkD7hOi3J5I/AAAAAAAAfIU/CPXFnxGyTUA/s288/P1470300.JPG" alt="20140519153207, "><span data-time="1400513527" class="timestamp"><p>Visas in hand, La guided us to a van (actually the same Toyota van model we had been using in Thailand, but as a left-hand drive model instead) and we were driven about 25 minutes upstream to our boat. The road went through a number of villages and wound up and down through the hills. Laos is noticeably poorer than Thailand. The streets are dirty again, trash is thrown in the ravines, bridges are one-lane wooden decked structures instead of two-lane paved spans. The houses we were seeing were not any smaller though, so there is that.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400514376" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-JVggHvL5Eko/VkD7hIC227I/AAAAAAAAfIU/NxBtIs2ofH8/s288/P1470302.JPG" alt="20140519154616, "><span data-time="1400514376" class="timestamp"><p>It turns out that we are the only people who booked the boat tour for today. Thus, as soon as we arrived at our boat, a 30' or 40' long craft which is probably capable of carrying 40 tourists, the crew of six readied the boat and cast off. We felt a little silly setting so many people in motion when we are only two people ourselves!</p><p>La explained to us that we would travel down stream for about seven hours until our lodge, which is the halfway point in the tour.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400514568" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-uCzLi5aVfjw/VkD7hPP1GQI/AAAAAAAAfIU/e87hP6qCfoY/s288/P1470304.JPG" alt="20140519154928, "><span data-time="1400514568" class="timestamp"><p>For the first hour or so Thailand was the right bank and we traveled and Laos was on the left. Both sides look roughly similar, with villages, farms and livestock along the river. Little boats dashed back and forth between the banks. The main difference with the Thai side is that they were actively fortifying the river bank against erosion. The Laos side was initially marked by a massive banana plantation which was Chinese owned and sent bananas back to China.</p><p>We questioned La about the government (runs like communist Vietnam does), schooling (free until college, most people do a vocational college), farming (we were seeing lots of sustenance rice farming of sticky rice on the hillsides), and past employment history (La had been a math and English teacher). La also told us about the three main tribes in Laos who lived at different elevations. Though we were in the low-land region right now, there are villages from mid-land and mountain tribes too because the government does not want to service remote villages and so has been encouraging those people to move near the Mekong where they can have access to electricity and schooling.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400518799" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-G8vIVBq5OUA/VkD7hFMUq0I/AAAAAAAAfIU/As_yUIZlVrk/s288/P1470322.JPG" alt="20140519165959, "><span data-time="1400518799" class="timestamp"><p>Our first brief stop of the day was just after Thailand disappeared from the right bank and we were fully within Laos territory. We stopped at a police post where the captain registered our journey and presumably gave the police an opportunity to search the boat. No police came on board today.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400522753" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-gQosabtMY2c/VkD7hDLCgGI/AAAAAAAAfIU/acDbR6PZ4pg/s288/P1470328.JPG" alt="20140519180553, "><span data-time="1400522753" class="timestamp"><p>The second stop was at a mid-lands (Kamau) tribe village. This village is actually very new and was started in 2009. It has about 450 people in it and they farm the surrounding countryside. We walked through the village feeling very out of place. The whole village is build over dirt (no green vegetation) and in the style of the Kamau the houses are about 1 meter off the ground and build out of bamboo. The children of the village stared at us as we walked past their houses and gawked at what is the most basic village Katrina and I had ever visited. The adults mostly ignored us. (It is low season now and in high season they must have hundreds of tourists each day).</p><p>Even though this village was very very poor, all the houses has electricity and many had satellite TV too. In some ways it was probably better than the mountain villages these people moved from. On the other hand they are now a tourist attraction.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400523964" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ByGa2e9FoDE/VkD7hIu5XFI/AAAAAAAAfIU/y8zOmRN_ATU/s288/IMG_3497.JPG" alt="20140519182604, "><span data-time="1400523964" class="timestamp"><p>We got back in the boat and continued downstream. We were served a generous lunch of curry, vegetables, and fries. The curry was tasty and very similar to Thai curry, though it did have hard boiled eggs in it. We played a game of Jenga with La. It was extra challenging on account of the lean of the boat and the rocking of the waves. I lost.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400530304" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-1gBrFcLFdeU/VkD7hOtBxNI/AAAAAAAAfIU/xRF-xvUiJx4/s288/P1470362.JPG" alt="20140519201144, "><span data-time="1400530304" class="timestamp"><p>For the rest of the trip Katrina and I sat on the bench at the bow of the boat and watched the world go by. The river is deep brown in color and has bright white sand along some banks. The sand must be washed downstream, as the earth around here is dark brown-red. Villages intermittently appear along both banks, though there was not always a road on the right bank. We passed water buffalo and cattle as well as goats. Locals were fishing in the river and other tourists were buzzing up and down in small speedboats which looked pretty rough and miserable.</p><p>The topography here is hilly, and the size of the hills grew and shrunk as we went downstream. Maybe the biggest hills we saw went up about 1000' above the river. The land closest to the river is farmed. Mostly it is slash and burn rice farming which is done on the hillsides without the help of terraces. La says that the sticky rice they are growing is not high quality enough to be sold at market, and so it is just to feed the farmer's family. Other things being grown included fruit, corn and hardwood. Hardwood is the primary export of Laos.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400534709" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-u2VZNXmpvAE/VkD7hONNqCI/AAAAAAAAfIU/0OnR9J6UxbU/s288/P1470372.JPG" alt="20140519212509, "><span data-time="1400534709" class="timestamp"><p>At about 3pm we passed the construction site for a major bridge which will span the Mekong. This will be the closest bridge to the friendship bridge. It will also service truck traffic coming from China and going on to Thailand.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400535744" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-OHlLWWVMfGs/VkD7hM6lfxI/AAAAAAAAfIU/oGt-BDXAlb8/s288/P1470374.JPG" alt="20140519214224, "><span data-time="1400535744" class="timestamp"><p>Just after the bridge we came to the Luang Say Lodge in the village of Pak Beng - our hotel for the evening. We landed and were given a cold towel and lemongrass drink at reception. Then we were handed the key to room 14, which is a little bungalow on stilts about 20' up above the river. From our bungalow we have papaya, banana and bamboo visible out our windows. We see the brown Mekong, and then a white sand bank on the far side with a tall mountain above. The bungalow is made of dark colored hardwood.</p><p>We relaxed and wrote in our journals.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400543990" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ruRUg9zfWPs/VkD7hHRYynI/AAAAAAAAfIU/2DTt-nx3AnU/s288/P1470390.JPG" alt="20140519235950, "><span data-time="1400543990" class="timestamp"><p>At about 5:30pm we walked into town. This port village is has one main paved road, is full of tourist guesthouses where people coming down the river can stay. Even though tourists are common here we still got a few stares. Maybe it was because I was sweating as profusely as I had the whole trip long! We walked to a temple then turned around and went back to the lodge.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400547756" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-T1C7h7H295Q/VkD7hBuIH9I/AAAAAAAAfIU/0YqjWZ0rXBs/s288/IMG_3560.JPG" alt="20140520010236, "><span data-time="1400547756" class="timestamp"><p>Dinner was outside on a porch. We had curry, salad, spring rolls, veggie soup and sticky rice. It was all tasty. The only other guest at the lodge is a German man.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400550884" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-GXeQx71ItDw/VkD7hAxtO8I/AAAAAAAAfIU/qoWBh1Ew2FA/s288/P1470407.JPG" alt="20140520015444, "><span data-time="1400550884" class="timestamp"><p>It was dark when we got back to the room. We showered and tried to make the mosquito net over our bed as bug-tight as possible. It worked fine to keep out the larger bugs, but those bugs which were smaller than a mosquito would get blown through the netting by the overhead fan. Nothing bit us anyway, but I did shoe away some bug that crawled into my armpit!</p><p id="endOfEntry">&lt;End of Journal&gt;</p></span>

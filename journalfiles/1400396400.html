<h2><a id="Chiang Mai to  Chiang Rai">Chiang Mai to  Chiang Rai</a></h2><h3><a id="1400396400">05/18/2014</a></h3><p>We started our day with our last breakfast at The Small (french toast again today). We both woke up achy all over our bodies from yesterday's riding. I woke up with a scratchy throat, swollen lymph nodes in the neck, and a stuffy nose. After breakfast we packed up our bags and met Nuk in the hotel lobby.</p><p>Today is mostly a transit day, with us going to Chiang Rai before tomorrow's Laos boat ride. We took a highway (not limited access) out of Chiang Mai and over a mountain pass to the next valley. The mountains here are not very large - maybe Pennsylvania scale. They are however covered in thick green forest.</p><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400430923" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XDLVcXSQ-qc/ViJ6XCZWgzI/AAAAAAAAUOc/mIzlLWh75Qs/s288/P1470204.JPG" alt="20140518163523, "><span data-time="1400430923" class="timestamp"><p>Half way over the mountain we stopped at a hill tribe road-side market. A number of stalls were selling dried peppers, fruits, spices and a limited number of vegetables. Nuk told us about how there are four different hill tribes in this part of Thailand, and how they have different dress and culture. Katrina bought some banana chips and we moved on.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400432086" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-OlKnicttpFc/ViJ6XF13gZI/AAAAAAAAUOc/YIQwnuGdwD4/s288/IMG_3394.JPG" alt="20140518165446, "><span data-time="1400432086" class="timestamp"><p>Our next short stop was just down the road where we visited a hot spring. Some enterprising person build a strip mall on the highway and piped in hot spring water from the other side of the road. I watched the fake geyser go off a few times and we both dipped our feet in the hot spring river (man made).</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400433843" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XkxCFnqtdGA/ViJ6XGpOv0I/AAAAAAAAUOc/zSfadVrQeDc/s288/IMG_3395.JPG" alt="20140518172403, "><span data-time="1400433843" class="timestamp"><p>Back down in another valley after our first mountain pass all of the roadside businesses returned to the side of the highway. Just beyond were acres and acres of rice fields. Rice is the predominant crop and the soil and climate here support is to well they can get three harvests in a year. We got out of the car and looked at one of the rice fields. The rice grain was clearly visible in the flooded field. I was amused to see hermit crabs in the water.</p><p>Nuk's phallic humor from the first day represented itself on today's ride. We heard jokes about penis size, the story of a shrine where people bring wooden penises as tribute, tales about the introduction of condoms to Northern Thailand. Oh well...</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400438813" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Uk6ge6qrT7k/ViJ6XM64lRI/AAAAAAAAUOc/bC8XjNwQ3Rk/s288/P1470218.JPG" alt="20140518184653, "><span data-time="1400438813" class="timestamp"><p>Next, we went to the white temple of Chiang Rai. This temple is a recent reconstruction from about 10 years ago. Its current design was made by a Thai artist to attract tourists to Chiang Rai. This white temple is equal parts Thai temple, disco ball (it is covered in mirrored tiles), and pop art (there are tributes to Michael Jackson inside and there is a Predator in the outside garden). A scene of anguished hands reaching up out of the concrete defines the entrance to the bridge to the temple. We were told this is Hell, and that visitors to the temple leave via another exit so that they do not need to return to Hell afterwards.</p><p>Because of the recent earthquakes here in Chiang Mai, were were not able to enter the temple ourselves. We could see that several of the spires were crooked or toppled, and that tile work and plaster was broken.</p><p>We got back in the car and went one hour north to the Golden Triangle, the place where Thailand, Myanmar and Laos all meet at a point. The borders are defined by the Mekong River and another smaller river. In both Laos and Myanmar there are casinos (gambling is outlawed in Thailand). We heard that wealthy Laos sometimes bring their expensive cars over to Thailand.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400444935" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-TXyRaJW5AAU/ViJ6XO4IYvI/AAAAAAAAUOY/q32L5WjEfjY/s288/P1470238.JPG" alt="20140518202855, "><span data-time="1400444935" class="timestamp"><p>At my request of Nuk, we ate lunch at a local restaurant (a restaurant for locals). The goal was for me to try a Thai-spicy red curry. I am under the impression that the food I have been getting fed is toned down for me. Beyond the curry we also had an omelet and a stir fried veggies with pineapple dish. We had Nuk taste our red curry - he rated it a 2 out of 5 on the spiciness scale. That seemed about right to us, as we thought it just on the warm side of medium spicy. It was not even the slightest struggle to eat the curry.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400446915" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-3JzQXCl13lI/ViJ6XKUAGJI/AAAAAAAAUOc/IhWkbtXD_Pg/s288/P1470244.JPG" alt="20140518210155, "><span data-time="1400446915" class="timestamp"><p>We then went to a nearby hilltop temple to overlook the Golden Triangle. The Mekong river was running with dark colored water. The tributary from Burma was bright with mud. Nuk tells us that we were looking into Shan country in Burma. The Shan are one of the groups which is fighting the central Myanmar government for independence.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400447581" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-BTdyOqBPbHw/ViJ6XKv021I/AAAAAAAAUOc/ukBVS1brWYo/s288/P1470256.JPG" alt="20140518211301, "><span data-time="1400447581" class="timestamp"><p>We checked out the temples at our overlook too. The most interesting thing here were four massive bees hives hanging in the eves of one of the temples. Unlike bees hives in America, there was no outside wall around these nests and we could see all the bees working the comb.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400448761" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-oXGG1L2KEko/ViJ6XF--54I/AAAAAAAAUOc/MYAc-I92Auw/s288/P1470263.JPG" alt="20140518213241, "><span data-time="1400448761" class="timestamp"><p>We took a short tour of the opium museum. Opium has been grown in the Golden Triangle area for quite a few years. The Thai government is doing its best to eradicate it from Thailand and find alternative crops for the local farmers, but of course some is still grown. It sounds like Burma is growing a lot still, especially in the resistance fighting areas that need cash for their war efforts.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400450527" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-2gD76QRhOKE/ViJ6XEIjb5I/AAAAAAAAUOY/7lJjoBD2BeI/s288/P1470265.JPG" alt="20140518220207, "><span data-time="1400450527" class="timestamp"><p>We peeked at another golden Buddha along the river (this one was a tribute to the Thai queen) and then returned by van to our Chiang Rai hotel.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400455287" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Bp-fF2nQfng/ViJ6XBzPjJI/AAAAAAAAUOc/fsAcekWda9E/s288/P1470268.JPG" alt="20140518232127, "><span data-time="1400455287" class="timestamp"><p>The hotel Mantrini is the nicest and biggest hotel we have had in Thailand.

It was packed with locals shopping and eating. The mall is 3 stories high, bit and bright. We passed by about 10 hot pot and Japanese restaurants before finding The Pizza Company off in a corner. Our spaghetti arrabiata and our veggie pizza were passable, good even. We took our first anti-malaria pill with dinner. We are a little anxious about these pills, but they are not the medicine associated with mental side-effects.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400463617" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Vug6TcCvNWk/VjeZkvjNXWI/AAAAAAAAemg/_KyhI3b-PtQ/s288/IMG_20140518_184017.jpg" alt="20140519014017, "><span data-time="1400463617" class="timestamp"><p>We returned to the hotel where Katrina texted via Skype with her parents and I got ready for bed.</p><p id="endOfEntry">&lt;End of Journal&gt;</p></span>

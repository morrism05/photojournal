We then went downstairs to investigate the hotel buffet breakfast as we were out of supplies in our own fridge. The buffet was pretty abysmal, but we made due with the mini pancakes and with the granola and milk.</p><p>After breakfast we went back and packed our bags for our departure from Japan. The biggest challenge was finding room for the three bottles of sake we purchased. I was able to take two in my hiking pack and Katrina packed one. We are hoping they survive the trip without breaking!</p><p>At about 9:30am we checked out of the room and had the hotel hold our packs. We headed for the Hagashiama and Gion side of the river to do a walking tour from our Lonely Planet guidebook.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402765926" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-bwUxj86cbjc/Vky2WN3FDwI/AAAAAAAAfYk/d1uSzqUwqJM/s288/P1500750.JPG" alt="20140614171206, "><span data-time="1402765926" class="timestamp"><p>Our tour would have started with Kiyomizu-dera temple, but we had already seen that a few days ago, so we skipped it and went straight to Sannen-zaka street with all of its cute houses and tourist shops.</p><p>We skipped Kodai-ji when we found out that it had an entrance fee. We only have a few yen left in our pockets, and we are trying to meter it out in small allotments which will get us through the day.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402768290" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-M6hyiNPI35U/Vky2WLSp32I/AAAAAAAAfYk/OJNJosswtBk/s288/P1500755.JPG" alt="20140614175130, "><span data-time="1402768290" class="timestamp"><p>We stopped to sit and eat an apple in Maruyama-koen park. Several young women were dressed as comic book warriors, so we watched them posing around a pond. This park was designed by the same person who designed Murin-an, but the park has not been kept up very well!</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402769838" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-j1P4sGmomuw/Vky2WBL8a5I/AAAAAAAAfYk/kUYHWWJG_Ao/s288/P1500756.JPG" alt="20140614181718, "><span data-time="1402769838" class="timestamp"><p>The park is adjacent to Yasaka-jinja shrine, which we visited next. This shrine is close to Gion geisha district and once a year at the New Years the geiko perform a public dance on the site. I think we spotted the dance stage in the center of the shrine complex.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402771041" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-6YAPNkg3fpI/Vky2WN4BXaI/AAAAAAAAfYg/UAoeGVvIjEY/s288/P1500761.JPG" alt="20140614183721, "><span data-time="1402771041" class="timestamp"><p>We continued on to Chion-in temple complex. We had hoped to visit the main hall here, but it is in fact under an eight year long restoration. We were instead able to enter the Honen shonin Mido (where services were being held this Saturday morning) and then we bought tickets to explore the Hojo Garden.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402772126" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-BZZKgfFOGio/Vky2WPbMOWI/AAAAAAAAfYg/1GmzaXxTnb0/s288/P1500762.JPG" alt="20140614185526, "><span data-time="1402772126" class="timestamp"><p>Hojo Garden was actually pretty small. There was a pond near the entrance and then an azalea bush and rock garden further along. The most interesting thing at these gardens (for me) were a pair of kingfisher birds with bright blue plumage.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402774239" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-FL6hLltQgdA/Vky2WOgAv0I/AAAAAAAAfV0/VqL_hNHAT74/s288/IMG_5246.JPG" alt="20140614193039, "><span data-time="1402774239" class="timestamp"><p>Our Hojo Garden ticket also got us into Yuzen-en garden, so we visited this too. There were a few small cottages in this garden, a pond (with jumping gold fish), and also an unraked rock garden with some mini palm trees at one corner.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402775528" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-p3k0HzbQl_k/Vky2WHrXHVI/AAAAAAAAfYc/b3Np00t9GhA/s288/P1500798.JPG" alt="20140614195208, "><span data-time="1402775528" class="timestamp"><p>After Chion-in, we walked next door to Shoren-in temple. Shoren-in turned out to be the highlight of the day. All of the temple spaces were open to our exploration. First, we entered a temple space with beautiful rice-paper wall murals of flowers, frogs, turtles and crabs. From this first all we could sit and look out over the pleasant pond and garden. There were two other halls for us to explore too, and they also had beautiful wall murals that we could inspect up close. In the carriage house we found scenes with cranes which really captured our attention.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402778082" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-JFDrGL5GhM4/Vky2WCdq10I/AAAAAAAAfYQ/4ataOB0KyBA/s288/P1500837.JPG" alt="20140614203442, "><span data-time="1402778082" class="timestamp"><p>After walking all of the shoes-off temple space, we then went out and walked through the gardens themselves. There was a small bamboo grove, and in the back end of the temple a massive camphor tree shaded half of the lawn.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402782565" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-G-GZcWctXbQ/Vky2WHywlNI/AAAAAAAAfYA/7XZBoeP12yg/s288/IMG_20140614_144925.jpg" alt="20140614214925, "><span data-time="1402782565" class="timestamp"><p>We left the temple and walked back to our hotel. I tried to find some food to eat along the way, but the places which were interesting to me all turned out to be cash-only. Back at the hotel we used the restrooms (the most sophisticated one yet with a toilet seat that opened and closed itself) and then donned our packs.</p><p>We took the subway to Kyoto station where we would catch the Shinkansen. At the ticket office I asked if we could get reserved seats on the Mt Fuji side of the train. The train we wanted to take did not have available seats with a Fuji view, so we purchased seats on the following train, the 4:56pm Nozomi 36 super express, instead.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402785012" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-6XBUIZlM9Hs/Vky2WGIJeGI/AAAAAAAAfYA/cxYnCtKY1WA/s288/IMG_20140614_153012.jpg" alt="20140614223012, "><span data-time="1402785012" class="timestamp"><p>We had 1.5 hours to kill before our departure, and so we went to Pastamore for a late lunch. I ordered the LL sized spaghetti with eggplant, as it turned out that all sizes of pasta dishes have the same cost. Katrina ordered a caprese salad. We thought my pasta dish might be a challenge to finish, but I was readily up for the task. After finishing our food, I sneakily poured our small bottle of sake into our water glasses so that we could drink it from glasses. It was not quite as good as I remember from the brewery. I'll be sure to drink my other sake cold.</p><p>We tried to find some snacks for the train ride, but the station bakery was cash only too.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402789659" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-NWsna_mUgzc/Vky2WBLC1eI/AAAAAAAAfYA/4hxAcqbMX6M/s288/P1500854.JPG" alt="20140614234739, "><span data-time="1402789659" class="timestamp"><p>We boarded the Nozomi 36 and found our window and aisle seats in car 10. The train was nearly full when it arrived at Kyoto, and I was happy we had reservations.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402789915" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7uOZa_pBc9k/Vky2WO_5EgI/AAAAAAAAfX8/dRBjotu2H2I/s288/P1500859.JPG" alt="20140614235155, "><span data-time="1402789915" class="timestamp"><p>This Nozomi 700 train is said to do 170 mph on the Tokaido line, so while it might not be fastest I have ever traveled on the ground it is certainly close. The train whizzes through the landscape and all the buildings and scenery immediately along the railway pass too quickly to ever come into focus. Looking up the carriage so that I can see out of the windows on both sides, the frantic passing of buildings and power poles is completely out of sync with the movements of the passengers' bodies within the car. The railroad is so smooth and the directional changes so gradual that we might as well be riding along in an airplane for all the disturbance in the cabin. (Actually, there is a roar of air to the train which is not so different from what is heard in an airline, just quieter.) Passengers' heads bob slightly to and fro, but really the ride is smoother than any slow train. we rode this trip. The strongest sensation is the linear acceleration as the train pulls away from a station. In would not be surprised if the same sort of sensations could be found I riding on a rocket.</p><p>As a super express our train would only make stops in Nagoya and Shin-Yokahama before reaching our destination of Shinagawa Tokyo. It only took us 30 minutes or so to reach Nagoya. The train seemed at its fastest just before we reached the Mount Fuji region of coastal mountains. In this same area the rice fields of the southern prefectures was replaced with fruit trees and tea plantations.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402795240" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-dnrwyctS3K8/Vky2WEVF4gI/AAAAAAAAfX8/opNLD_J7xVQ/s288/P1500870.JPG" alt="20140615012040, "><span data-time="1402795240" class="timestamp"><p>Mt Fuji was out our window for just five minutes or so as we rocketed past. Getting a clear photography of the mountain through the urban environment was impossible.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402806654" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-zW5Zgin41Hg/Vky2WLr7QTI/AAAAAAAAfWY/SKpA9853Oz8/s288/P1500945.JPG" alt="20140615043054, "><span data-time="1402806654" class="timestamp"><p>From Shin-Yokahama it was only ten minutes or so to our destination at Shinagawa. Our total time was 2h10m to travel the 290 miles. We transferred to the Keikyu Lines Haneda Airport Express. Getting checked in for our ANA flight 0116 to Vancouver and clearing security and immigration was completely painless without any lines.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402806695" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-3cZOpHDIanA/Vky2WHD79TI/AAAAAAAAfWY/IFqcSsLiywQ/s288/P1500946.JPG" alt="20140615043135, "><span data-time="1402806695" class="timestamp"><p>We used the airport WiFi while waiting for our 9:55pm flight to begin boarding. Looking out the windows I was surprised by how many new 787 Dreamliners ANA has in its fleet. ANA must be one of Boeing's primary customers for the new plane. Our plane is an aging 767 with poor legroom. At least we have a selection of movies. I watched a Japanese movie about a woman who is looking for a husband, a contract killer with amnesia, and an out of luck actor.</p><p>What would I do differently on the next sabbatical? I feel like we burned out a little after four or five weeks of travel. Being in Japan with a kitchen helped a little, but we still lacked our original energy. We also wanted for contact from family and friends at that point. Perhaps next time we should only go for four weeks and use the other two weeks at home or with family.</p><p>Also, while we did manage in Japan on our own (with some stress over finding meals), it would have been good to have a tour guide every few days so we could ask the questions we came up with and so that we would learn more background about the historical sights we were seeing. I am sure we missed many good stories on the temples we visited.</p><p>Finally, we seemed to have many days in our itinerary where all we did was transit between locations. I suppose this is unavoidable if we are going to see so many places, but I do feel like one week of our six weeks was probably just spent going to or coming from airports.</p><p>Next trip to Japan it would be nice to see the Japanese Alps in the summer!</p><p id="endOfEntry">&lt;End of Journal&gt;</p></span>

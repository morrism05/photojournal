<h2><a id="Luang Prabang">Luang Prabang</a></h2><h3><a id="1400742000">05/22/2014</a></h3><p>As on the days before, we had breakfast in the hotel restaurant, then returned to our room and got ready for the day's tour. Today was a trekking day to visit some semi remote villages.</p><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400770965" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-qaP4FILcy1Y/VkoafRfcjyI/AAAAAAAAfKM/QNZYO7OVizQ/s288/P1470924.JPG" alt="20140522150245, "><span data-time="1400770965" class="timestamp"><p>Ken met us at 7:30 am and there was a 45 minute drive out of the city to a hillside resort. From there we met our hiking guide Joy. He is a 35 year old (or so) Hmong man from a nearby mountain top village.</p><p>Katrina was a bit nervous about doing a hike today, as the weather has been so hot! We had voiced this concern to Ken, and so he and Joy reduced the trek plan from its original 19km to a more manageable 10km. We brought along 2.5 liters of water too.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400771542" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ENCpi4IpewU/VkoafW64SHI/AAAAAAAAfKM/5-W455JwRwY/s288/P1470925.JPG" alt="20140522151222, "><span data-time="1400771542" class="timestamp"><p>The hike started after a short boat ride across the Nam Khan river. Our first hour or two of walking was through teak forest and along slash and burn farms. The fields are mostly in their freshly burnt state right now, as they are waiting for the rainy season for planting. Other than coconut and banana trees, we did not recognize any other fruit trees. We passed a few people which were pumping some sort of solution out of plastic tanks and through a sprayer onto the fields. Joy says this is a salt solution to kill the existing plants, and that the rains will wash it away before corn is planted. I was wondering if it was really a herbicide.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400775421" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-BdhacP2iodY/VkoafRIc3nI/AAAAAAAAfKM/tBWsMTIOn4w/s288/P1470937.JPG" alt="20140522161701, "><span data-time="1400775421" class="timestamp"><p>Our first rest stop was in a Kamu village of about 350 people. Even through the walk to this point had been mostly on the level, we were both drenched in sweat. We downed more water.</p><p>This village has a school, and the children were having their final exams. Otherwise the village was largely empty, with just a few young children and their parents about. Joy saws that while the government pays for the teachers, it doesn't pay for the school buildings or supplies for the children. These the parents or village must fund. Due to the cost of books, some families can only send one or two of their children to school.</p><p>This village does not have a connection to the electrical grid, but a few houses had small solar panels (big enough to power some lights) and we learned that other houses have generators to run their TVs.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400777634" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-d7yBEMhUV_o/VkoafeqOz0I/AAAAAAAAfKM/LqBGtb11JOw/s288/P1470953.JPG" alt="20140522165354, "><span data-time="1400777634" class="timestamp"><p>We walked a couple more hours, winding into the hills and along more fields prepared for planting. Every so often the path would leave the cultivated landscape and wind along a creek bed or up a hillside and through a thicket (usually of bamboo). The climbs were especially difficult as we were already sweating from every pore on our bodies and the air was too hot and humid to facilitate evaporative cooling.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400780831" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-h2KwA6cIas0/VkoafVKvNQI/AAAAAAAAfKM/WF6AUek7zm4/s288/P1470960.JPG" alt="20140522174711, "><span data-time="1400780831" class="timestamp"><p>Eventually we made it up to the second village, a Hmong village. We did not see anyone here, just lots of chickens running around and scratching. (Joy said that the local joke is that a flock of chicks is the Lao soccer team, all running around haphazardly and scratching at the ground.)</p><p>We asked Joy about who was coming down from the mountains to riverside villages and why. Joy said the reason the government wants to move villagers out of the mountains is because it is trying to prevent deforestation in the county. Laos used to be covered in 70% forest and now it is down to just 35%. When there are small villages in the mountain the government requires the people move down, but it does not actually pay them for their land or buy them new homes and land in the low areas. These they must buy on their own. Joy's mountain village is able to continue to be inhabited because it has a large population. Unlike La who made it sound like the mountain villagers were happy to move out of the mountains, Joy made it pretty clear that many Hmong were not happy with the forced relocation.</p><p>Joy told us that the people in his village are farming food, but even a decade ago farming opium was popular. Now, it is just the most remote villages which get away with opium farming.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400783011" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-r8M9QEwet_I/Vkoafdh4gNI/AAAAAAAAfKM/W6He-Id31mM/s288/P1470965.JPG" alt="20140522182331, "><span data-time="1400783011" class="timestamp"><p>Third part of our hike was a descent from the mountain. We had grand views down valleys (often farmed) and to the mountain ridges beyond. The mountains are very green and lush. We passed through some rubber tree orchards too on this part of our hike.</p><p>The heat was really getting to me by this point, and I was not enjoying the hike. Katrina later looked up the weather for the day and found that in Luang Prabang the high was nearly 100F. In the shady parts of our hike it may not have been nearly that high, but there were parts of our hike through cleared grounds where it felt like we were in an oven.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400786647" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Qq9xGAbunRc/VkoafYqpcCI/AAAAAAAAfKM/920Xadh73xU/s288/P1470985.JPG" alt="20140522192407, "><span data-time="1400786647" class="timestamp"><p>Eventually we made it to our third village, a larger village which is home to a mix of tribal peoples. We sat under a canopy near the village store, ate frozen fruit pops and our fried rice lunch, and generally tried to recover. The shopkeep was a woman who looked maybe 40 at most, but it turned out she was a grandmother. Her granddaughters were hanging out, playing and eating candy. We watched other little children playing too, some with knifes where were larger than their heads! People seem pretty nonchalant about big knifes in Laos.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400790070" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-CHn0Zm0Bexw/VkoafYBJyiI/AAAAAAAAfKM/nomr6tbIlqo/s288/P1470996.JPG" alt="20140522202110, "><span data-time="1400790070" class="timestamp"><p>We had the choice of either walking one more hour or taking a boat to our pick-up point. We chose (unwisely?) to walk, and ventured through more empty fields, then through a large plantation of rubber trees. At this plantation the trees had the little sap spigots and collection cups. Joy showed us how the rubber sap is white and extremely stretch. It also is stinky when it has been sitting around for a while! Lao people are choosing to plant rubber instead of teak because the price for teak has fallen a lot and because the rubber trees are productive in only 6 years and then provide income for multiple consecutive years.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400792091" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_tXOlgAg8B4/VkoafUbzNNI/AAAAAAAAfKM/Y92D0aVXqNg/s288/P1480005.JPG" alt="20140522205451, "><span data-time="1400792091" class="timestamp"><p>Our hike ended with another Nam Khan river crossing by boat (the local boats are powered by what more or less is an oversized immersion blender). 15 minutes later Ken and our van driver picked us up and we drove the 45 minutes back to the hotel.</p><p>We showered, rested, drank water and tried to recover from the heat. All of our massively sweaty clothes were hand washed in the sink. We then went to the pool to swim and cool down some more.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400807436" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-nKuKm-7nGhE/VkoafXtNOXI/AAAAAAAAfKM/TYguiSNys8g/s288/P1480009.JPG" alt="20140523011036, "><span data-time="1400807436" class="timestamp"><p>We had a snack of fresh rolls at the pool. They contained lettuce, egg, noodles and cabbage. This peaked our appetite for dinner, so we dressed and ate dinner at the hotel. The fried crispy riverweed and the green salad with egg dressing were good. The gazpacho on the other hand was a complete surprise! It was a sweet and somewhat bubbly cold tomato soup into which the kitchen had scooped a generous ball of vanilla ice cream. We tried out best to eat the two parts separately; each was OK on its own.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400808744" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-lcGMKUB7Rkc/VkoafYono5I/AAAAAAAAfKM/o3co85ZXzRk/s288/P1480012.JPG" alt="20140523013224, "><span data-time="1400808744" class="timestamp"><p>Still hungry after dinner we walk across the bamboo bridge to old town to see if any bakeries were still open. The cafe where we had lunch yesterday was open and its dessert case called to us. We ordered banana tart and banana pudding. Both were good. Then we took a small baguette home with us.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400810911" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-rZGLdOlLjuc/VkoafXgmjdI/AAAAAAAAfKM/biN7paWYOUA/s288/P1480014.JPG" alt="20140523020831, "><span data-time="1400810911" class="timestamp"><p>Our room was not getting cool, and we determined that the AC unit was broken. The front desk clerk, an ever smiling man in his mid twenties, sent by a handyman to look at the unit but ultimately moved us into a new room.</p><p>Cool again we headed to bed.</p><p id="endOfEntry">&lt;End of Journal&gt;</p></span>

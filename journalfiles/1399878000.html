<h2><a id="Pokhara to Kathmandu">Pokhara to Kathmandu</a></h2><h3><a id="1399878000">05/12/2014</a></h3><p>Last night's Indian-style wedding quieted down at 10pm and thankfully did not keep me from sleeping. I did however wake up to find I had bug bites on my arms and feet. I presume I got them at dinner, but I may have gotten them in the night. I hope they were not disease carrying mosquitoes!</p><p>We got up not long after sunrise. I checked to see if the mountains were visible this morning. Only one of the peaks could be seen and the others were hidden behind haze and smog.</p><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399902363" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-k51dzEu-5rQ/U_dLcR1wYVI/AAAAAAAADvU/FCO07VHnPRA/s288/P1460731.JPG" alt="20140512134603, "><span data-time="1399902363" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399902363" class="timestamp"><p>We went down to breakfast and ate alone. Then we sat outside near the pool and did more internet reading.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399914764" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-fseOn9LCzgk/U_dLdCVw48I/AAAAAAAADv0/za_XzWBk1Go/s288/P1460732.JPG" alt="20140512171244, "><span data-time="1399914764" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399914764" class="timestamp"><p>We went back to our room, packed our bags, and checked out. Together with Tilak and our tripmates we took a van to the Pokhara airport where we waited for our Yeti Air flight. The flight left around 10:15am and was thankfully uneventful. There was not much to see out of the windows because of the haze.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399919045" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-4RB5nrLr1iM/U_dLeG4DXjI/AAAAAAAADvs/ZlMO6LMDfZ8/s288/P1460734.JPG" alt="20140512182405, "><span data-time="1399919045" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399919045" class="timestamp"><p>After landing in Kathmandu, we took another van to the Shangri-La Hotel. Traffic was pretty bad so we all got a good soaking in the dust and exhaust fumes. I am very much over this city. Katrina also noted how on motorcycles only the drivers wear helmets and passengers go without.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399923576" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-xc503QK0Axg/U_dLgiVRYTI/AAAAAAAADwY/7NGif3ifosI/s288/P1460740.JPG" alt="20140512193936, "><span data-time="1399923576" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399923576" class="timestamp"><p>Once at the hotel Tilak gave us our hiking passports and souvenirs. We also received our room keys, but the room we were given had two twin beds, so we requested another. They king bed room was not yet ready, so Katrina and I had lunch of pita sandwiches and eggplant lasagna in the hotel restaurant.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399924621" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-cngP_mNtdUM/U_dLhowAoqI/AAAAAAAADw4/XfXsq8W98QM/s288/P1460742.JPG" alt="20140512195701, "><span data-time="1399924621" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399924621" class="timestamp"><p>Our new room was on the third floor facing the garden. This room looks to have been recently refurbished, and is very beautiful with rich wood floors, accent lighting and high quality touches. The garden view is also pleasant. We can get the garden free WiFi from the room too, which is a bonus. We watched bits of Jurassic Park and Home Alone on the TV.</p><p>We did more internet browsing and Katrina got a massage at the hotel spa. She returned looking blissful. I shaved of the beard that I'd grown on the trek.</p><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399945713" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--ErKyDqygIA/VjeZI7ZFUkI/AAAAAAAAemM/yvGIVrYa8jY/s288/IMG_20140512_184833.jpg" alt="20140513014833, "><p>For dinner Tilak took the whole trekking group into Thamil to Kilroy's of Kathmandu for dinner. We dined outside on a rooftop with candles to light the table. It would have been romantic except for the fact that there was a diesel generator causing a racket and making it difficult to hold a conversation. Kat and I had roasted veggies and ginger pumpkin soup.</p><p>After dinner we said goodbye to our trekmates and Tilak. Trevor, Sally and Judy are going on to Chitwan to see the animals; John and Marylin are going to the USA to do some touring of the west.</p><p id="endOfEntry">&lt;End of Journal&gt;</p></span></span>

Well, they were mostly visible through the smog.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399815387" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-e-n4iE1Cflg/U_dLOtVuN2I/AAAAAAAADsU/dKYvU8DEy7U/s288/P1460704.JPG" alt="20140511133627, "><span data-time="1399815387" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399815387" class="timestamp"><p>We went down to the breakfast buffet. There were curried chickpeas, cereals, baked goods and an omelet bar. It was a nice breakfast, though not as good as the one from Shangri-La Kathmandu.</p><p>We saw John, Sally, Judy and Trevor at breakfast too. John and Marylin are staying put at the hotel. Sally and Judy had plans to go for a boat ride on Lake Fewa. Trevor was going to walk around town.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399821923" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Z7GWGSPgPBg/U_dLQHFEbGI/AAAAAAAADsw/F5Q1uuE-p8A/s288/P1460707.JPG" alt="20140511152523, "><span data-time="1399821923" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399821923" class="timestamp"><p>Katrina and I went for a walk along the lakeside ourselves. There are a number of locations where people can rent small boats to paddle on the lake. In most places Lake Fewa looks a bit scummy and unappealing. And the vistas down the lake are smogged-in too. We walked a pedestrian path along the lake and passed several fisheries, as well as numerous restaurants with elaborate lake view gardens.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399823761" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-QBBEJs4H7js/U_dLXJfsbAI/AAAAAAAADuQ/LkmZWurjvKU/s288/P1460721.JPG" alt="20140511155601, "><span data-time="1399823761" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399823761" class="timestamp"><p>We walked back south along the parallel avenue, passing many restaurants with tourists taking their breakfasts. We also watched kids in school uniforms getting picked up by school buses. My earlier comments about the vendors not being so aggressive do not apply here. We were namaste'ed many times as people tried to sell shaves, food and tours.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399825079" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-6DODdt6RDjc/U_dLYWnIVrI/AAAAAAAADuY/5PhVV-dSpsY/s288/P1460724.JPG" alt="20140511161759, "><span data-time="1399825079" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399825079" class="timestamp"><p>We passed south of where our hotel's street comes out on the lake, and found a nice vista which overlooked a clean portion of the lake with green forests on the opposite bank. This was the most pleasant view of the evening.</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399826038" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-f3caURvi350/U_dLaIRqqqI/AAAAAAAADu0/B9xyqAdYxQQ/s288/P1460728.JPG" alt="20140511163358, "><span data-time="1399826038" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399826038" class="timestamp"><p>We walked back to the hotel via a different streets, and found that the whole lake side neighborhood is a a mix of hotels and farmed lots. It should not be long until all of the farms have been converted!</p></span></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399827710" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-nbdJ7uHJcSs/U_dLbrxQZII/AAAAAAAADvM/eb0qvla_8U8/s288/P1460730.JPG" alt="20140511170150, "><span data-time="1399827710" class="timestamp"><span data-time="1399827710" class="timestamp"><p>Back at the hotel, we put on our bathing suits and staked out lounge chairs by the pool. We caught up on email, read webpages (the first reviews of the 2014 M3 are out) and periodically took dips in the pool. The pool area was a pleasant place to spend the day. From our location we were able to hear some sort of a marching band in town, which was using horns in such a way that it sounded like a herd of elephants was on the street!</p><p>We eventually had lunch of paneer curry and cheese pizza at the pool, then returned to our room to relax more out of the sun. We ended up playing cards and watching a Bollywood movie.</p><p>At about 5:30pm we met our trip mates at the pool then migrated into the poolside bar for drinks. I ordered a gin and tonic and was a bit worried when the barkeep washed the shot glass in tap water. The bar itself was extremely divey, with graffiti on all the walls. We ended up talking about education for girls and women and also about Australian traffic and transportation problems. Apparently there are quite a few bicyclists being run off the roads in Australia!</p><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1399859871" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-enM-7ZeeEuY/VjeZI-X4k0I/AAAAAAAAemQ/bj_4MXJ2YUA/s288/IMG_20140511_185751.jpg" alt="20140512015751, "><p>Tilak briefly talked with us at 6:30pm - we will be leaving for the airport tomorrow at 9am - and then we all wandered into town to get dinner. We went to Once Upon A Time, a restaurant that Katrina found online, and enjoyed pineapple pizza and a veggie burger. The conversation remained Australian focused. I get the sense that Trevor has different political views than does John! I would love to hear about how the political parties are formed in Australia and what ideologies they have, but I did not dare ask at dinner!</p><p>We went back home and prepared for bed. There is an Indian-style wedding being held poolside, and we can hear the music through the poorly sealed windows.</p><p id="endOfEntry">&lt;End of Journal&gt;</p></span></span>

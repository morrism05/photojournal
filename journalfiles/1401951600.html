Katrina and I got up a little before 7am, packed and had breakfast at the hotel. The hotel dining room was brimming with guests, mostly elderly Japanese. The buffet was 100% Japanese breakfast with rice, miso, fish, cold cuts, and salad. Kat and I managed to pick together a western breakfast of scrambled eggs, yogurt, cereal and fruit from the available food.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401982650" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-N_uDTv0-N_E/Vky3VSz5xCI/AAAAAAAAfXo/4bv8-1hRiCw/s288/IMG_20140605_083730.jpg" alt="20140605153730, "><span data-time="1401982650" class="timestamp"><p>We retrieved our bags from the room and then checked out of the hotel. It was still raining as we walked the five minutes to the JR station. To our surprise Joy and Annemarie were standing at the station's front. Also there was an Australian hiker we recognized from our last two nights on the trail. He said he had made it over the last pass yesterday before the rain came in. He did hit a little drizzle though, and it made the final descent slippery.</p><p>We went to the ticket counter and purchased our tickets to Osaka's Tennoji station, then waited on the platform in the rain for the train. We were a little puzzled as to why Joy and Annemarie were not waiting for the train too, until we realized that they would be catching a train in the opposite direction to get to Tokyo. Thus, for a second time we did not say goodbye to them.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401983773" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-rQWRhKgnlxA/Vky3VXHSRcI/AAAAAAAAfXs/zctKgwr9b38/s288/P1490566.JPG" alt="20140605155613, "><span data-time="1401983773" class="timestamp"><p>It rained for first hour or two as the train traveled west and then north along the coast. We saw a few surfers on trying to catch the waves from the storm. We also passed by many coves and inlets in the coast, some of which were full of fishing boats.</p><p>The rain let-up just about as soon as we made it back to Tanabe. From here on out to Osaka the weather improved and the visibility was good too. We realized that this post-storm day was the first day we had views without smog.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401999100" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-c7Xs_Jra-X0/Vky3VRw7afI/AAAAAAAAfXs/GnFdx4zJU1w/s288/P1490577.JPG" alt="20140605201140, "><span data-time="1401999100" class="timestamp"><p>When we arrived at Tennoji, we took the subway to our Shinsaibashi station and then found a Mos Burger. This fast food restaurant had been recommended for its veggie burger. We ordered by looking at a picture menu, and got two rice paddy "burgers" with burdock and carrot filling. The burgers were actually more like the rice balls with filling that we have been eating in our bento boxes; the bun was toasted sushi rice and the paddy was chopped, seasoned and cooked veggies. All in all it was a nice meal, which we supplemented with onion rings.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402000950" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--2qLXGw2Mdo/Vky3VcHWcQI/AAAAAAAAfXs/R7oCXmHK5so/s288/P1490578.JPG" alt="20140605204230, "><span data-time="1402000950" class="timestamp"><p>We checked into the Cross Hotel and this time were given a room on the 10th floor. We have more interesting views out of the window than before.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402007931" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-eUiwtkK5Dc0/Vky3VWF2EgI/AAAAAAAAfXU/8OsmSWReUSw/s288/IMG_4500.JPG" alt="20140605223851, "><span data-time="1402007931" class="timestamp"><p>We decided that we should go to the floating garden observatory of the Umeda Sky Building since the air is so clear right now. We took the subway to Umeda, then walked through the massive rail station and mall complex of the attached Japan Rail Osaka station, and out on to the streets to get to the Umeda Sky Building.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402009931" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7FDCnVcARGo/Vky3VfSGbZI/AAAAAAAAfXk/-fmLU3w5Rps/s288/P1490583.JPG" alt="20140605231211, "><span data-time="1402009931" class="timestamp"><p>This building boasts having the highest escalator in the world. I think what they are trying to say is that the escalator spans a gap of open air (between two towers of the building) and the open air distance between the ground and the escalator is the biggest in the world. Anyway, it seems like a technicality to me!</p><p>With a little difficulty we finally found the right tower of the building and the right series of escalators and elevators to get to the top observation deck. From there we could see long views in all four directions. To the west we were overlooking Kobe and the bay, to the south Osaka stretches towards the Kii peninsula (this is the direction we came from on the train today), to the east is the heart of Umeda and commercial Osaka, and where most of the skyscrapers are found, and to the north the city expands to the hills between it and Kyoto. Actually, except for the east which is bounded by bay, Osaka is bounded by hills/mountains on all sides. The hills are quite far away though, and so there is a vast urban area before they are reached.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402012507" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-zwQeP9FyRK0/Vky3VWTLgaI/AAAAAAAAfXo/qlcP2yIrcEE/s288/P1490608.JPG" alt="20140605235507, "><span data-time="1402012507" class="timestamp"><p>The other funny thing about the observation deck is that it was love themed and that they had a wedding chapel somewhere on the top few stories.</p><p>We left the roof and started looking for dinner. Katrina had her heart set on a salad. The strategy we took was to go into each shopping tower or department store tower, look at the directory to figure out what restaurants they had, and only visit the restaurants which might have salads.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402018034" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_OUFKR6b-ZQ/Vky3VQN9EII/AAAAAAAAfXk/PM7wc7VgMZY/s288/P1490614.JPG" alt="20140606012714, "><span data-time="1402018034" class="timestamp"><p>Thus. we looked on the restaurant levels of three adjacent shopping complexes. We were tempted by bibimbap at a Korean restaurant and also by buffet farm-fresh restaurant in the Osaka station mall, but ultimately turned them down because they were either too expensive or they did not have English menus and we were not sure the food would be vegetarian. In the end we ate in a Dean &amp; Delucca's NYC American food restaurant on the basement level of the Grand Front Osaka. The waitress spoke enough English to help us translate the menu. We ordered sides of tomatoes, carrots and eggplant, and then I had a "red bitter salad" and Katrina a Caesar salad, hold the anchovies, add tomatoes. All of our requests were accommodated and our desire for salad satiated.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402021095" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-QaVxO5o0Jlk/Vky3VRqO_8I/AAAAAAAAfXU/MiyzBJek2C4/s288/IMG_4513.JPG" alt="20140606021815, "><span data-time="1402021095" class="timestamp"><p>This exploring of the malls to find dinner was very interesting (and overwhelming too!) as so many people were out commuting on foot home from the office. Added to this were shoppers and a sprinkling of tourists. Leaving Osaka and coming back reminds us of how well dressed Osaka men and women are! Many of the men are in suits, and the women are dressed super well too. The locals certainly have a cornucopia of shopping opportunities to put together there wardrobe in central Osaka.</p><p>We decided to walk back to the hotel on foot. Our path mostly followed Midosuji Ave. We tried to explore parallel streets but not until we came to the shopping arcades did we find anything lively. The northmost shopping arcades were mostly closed for the evening (at 8pm), but as we got closer and closer to Dotonbori and Namba more and more stores and restaurants were open. The crowds on the street grow thick too, and peaked at the river near the Cross Hotel.</p><p>We circled the block once to see if we could locate a breakfast place for tomorrow (we did not find one yet), then went back to the hotel to retire.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1402025742" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-o37ofa642Cs/Vky3VedGB-I/AAAAAAAAfXs/WouDd7FOgWo/s288/P1490627.JPG" alt="20140606033542, "><span data-time="1402025742" class="timestamp"><p id="endOfEntry">&lt;End of Journal&gt;</p></span>

The view over the valley was very pretty, with a fog hiding the town below. We took a few pictures then went back to bed.</p><p>We woke up for the second time at 7:30 am, packed our bags and got ready for the day of hiking. I had the idea that we could hike the four hours to our next guesthouse, drop off our bags, then hike another 7km of the trail with less luggage, find a bus stop and take the bus back to the hotel. The goal of this plan was to shorten our hike for tomorrow, which would have been an onerous 23km otherwise.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401636287" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-fjA_mIGm3Lw/Vky3VRA9rhI/AAAAAAAAfXk/QPq3IUoYvmk/s288/P1480898.JPG" alt="20140601152447, "><span data-time="1401636287" class="timestamp"><p>At 8:30 am we headed out to the dining room to check out and eat breakfast. To our surprise, the high school boy who took photos with us yesterday was waiting in the dining room! He had come to give us prints of the photographs from yesterday. We were very touched and amazed by this gesture!</p><p>We had our breakfast of vegetables, miso soup, eggs and rice, then left the ryokan. The first part of the hike was through the alleys of Takahara. We passed a few elderly people tending the garden.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401639360" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ro3-UakpuD8/ViK832t1AfI/AAAAAAAAXnM/XQfukhmX_uc/s288/IMG_4221.JPG" alt="20140601161600, "><span data-time="1401639360" class="timestamp"><p>We then hiked up and up through the woods. Initially, most of the woods appeared to be forested for lumber (or other wood product), as all of the trees were young and arrow straight, and the ground around the trees was completely cleared. Every so often we would hike through an unmaintained portion of woods and here the ground would be covered with scrub or ferns and the trees would grow at haphazard angles. (Still, the trees here seemed pretty young too.)</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401639933" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ljhgAsEyFaY/ViK83_YaisI/AAAAAAAAXsM/RhoH9Zj-Nm4/s288/IMG_4224.JPG" alt="20140601162533, "><span data-time="1401639933" class="timestamp"><p>We were basically the only people on the trail and I kept walking through spider webs. My solution was to find a long stick to hold out ahead of me as I walked. This web catcher worked pretty well at keeping the webs off my face. I felt a bit like a wizard from Harry Potter tromping through the woods with a wand raised in front of me.</p><p>The main plant which is flowering right has little white flowers with three petals. The scent of the flowers is actually pretty strong and smells like honey. Sometimes we would round a bend and the whole forest started smelling of the flowers.</p><p>We had seen salamanders in the rice paddies, and many lizards along the trail. However, during our climb Katrina spotted a blue skinned snake streaking away from the path. We think it may have been a Japanese rat snake Today would be the day of snakes for us, as we spotted two more snakes later.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401646939" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-e_gtvrgHstM/Vky3VVzhInI/AAAAAAAAfXk/H8ZIM6xPjLk/s288/P1480947.JPG" alt="20140601182219, "><span data-time="1401646939" class="timestamp"><p>Our hike summitted at the Three-fold Moon viewing point, at about 700m. We walked to the viewpoint but the trees were too thick to seen the surrounding mountains. We could tell that there were green mountains on all sides though.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401647321" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-vfRlm-HpPcY/Vky3VRXvPbI/AAAAAAAAfXo/w-UROIJrM7c/s288/P1480949.JPG" alt="20140601182841, "><span data-time="1401647321" class="timestamp"><p>From the Three-fold Moon point we descended steeply. Soon we reached a stream gully where the stream ran parallel to the old highway. This portion of the trail was my favorite of the day. Tall straight trees all around, stream burbling nearby, and green ferns and shrub filling the understory. It was very pretty. It was clear that this stream was of some importance to the region, as many stone and concrete walls guided its path.</p><p>When we left the streams side near Hwy 311, we hiked through forest which appeared to once have been cultivated land. The trees are growing on terraces. We would see more evidence of this later in the day too.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401650708" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-qTDBQAF2prw/Vky3VZYSRUI/AAAAAAAAfXs/iwwGL8JSNLs/s288/P1480979.JPG" alt="20140601192508, "><span data-time="1401650708" class="timestamp"><p>We ate our lunch at about 12:25 pm at the Gyuba-doji statue. We sat on a bench and ate the two plum riceballs, pickles, orange slice and banana that the ryokan had packed for us.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401651924" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-AVqlbteT49M/Vky3VfXsa7I/AAAAAAAAfXU/d9-8LyOEYsA/s288/045-P1480986.JPG" alt="20140601194524, "><span data-time="1401651924" class="timestamp"><p>We made it to Chikatsuyu, the town in which our our minshuku (guesthouse) is located. Our hike had been 9.3km to get to town. We watched some farmers use a small tractor to plant rice starts in their flooded rice field. Then we crossed the Hiki-gawa River and asked at coffee house for the location of the minshuku . The woman behind the counter spoke some English, but we still needed her to come out of the cafe and point us down the right street. The minshuku is right along the river and adjacent to the onsen.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401653170" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-pnoDsp4s83w/Vky3VZwDQuI/AAAAAAAAfXs/sI4DScc3owk/s288/P1480995.JPG" alt="20140601200610, "><span data-time="1401653170" class="timestamp"><p>We arrived around 1 pm, two hours before check-in. The host here is very friendly but with limited English. We were able to explain to him that we wanted to drop off our bags, continue hiking, and take the bus back from the Kobiro-toge bus stop. Our host understood the plan and got a few printed bus schedules and an regional map for us to use. He circled the times for the bus and where it would drop us off. We could either catch a 3 pm or 4 pm bus depending on our pace.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401654165" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-qgDKxcHVSWo/Vky3VZ0-tSI/AAAAAAAAfXs/-0R8usVtdSk/s288/P1480997.JPG" alt="20140601202245, "><span data-time="1401654165" class="timestamp"><p>The next section of the Kumano Kodo trail is different from those prior because it is along paved one-lane roads. We first walked out of Chikatsuyu, a town of maybe 1,000 people, past a very large and fresh looking school. Then we wound along the small roads through the rural neighborhoods and in and out of the forest. This section on the paved road was actually pretty nice, because we got to see more of how people live and also because we got longer views down the valley and across to the opposing mountain sides. From the looks of it there is quite a bit of forestry in this area.</p><p>The people in this area seem to have good sized houses, but houses that look a bit tired. They live on plots of land which are about an acre (or more) in size, and have gardens or even rice paddies. I presume most people here are farmers, but I don't know for sure.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401656732" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Whr8SIloEWQ/Vky3VZuJcNI/AAAAAAAAfXo/9YavYGAK96o/s288/P1490016.JPG" alt="20140601210532, "><span data-time="1401656732" class="timestamp"><p>We stopped at a few shrines along the way. Most of the shrines on our hike have been small stone monuments of maybe two feet in height, either carved with the figure of a person or carved with words. The nicest shrine of the day was Tsugizakura-oji. What I liked about this location is that six old growth cedar trees lined the staircase up to the shrine. These are by far the largest trees we have seen on our hike, and might be 20 feet in circumference.</p><p>Towards the end of our afternoon hike we thought we might be able to catch the 3 pm bus if we caught it one stop closer than our original goal. We were hiking quickly with this in mind, but time was getting very close. We would have needed to do 0.4km of spur road down to Hwy 311 in about two minutes if we were to be at the bus station in time, so we decided not to push it. Sure enough, we saw the bus go by in the distance as we hiked along to the next stop.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401661603" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-lNfH0gR818g/Vky3VU7t06I/AAAAAAAAfXo/t8gtRusMGbU/s288/P1490035.JPG" alt="20140601222643, "><span data-time="1401661603" class="timestamp"><p>It only took 15 more minutes to get to the general area of the next stop. We hung out along a stream for a bit, then went down to the stop to await the bus. It arrived exactly on time, and took ten minutes to take us back to Chikatsuyu, a distance which had been two hours of uphill hiking on foot.</p><p>Back in town we looked in the local market for some fresh food as snacks. I had hoped to find some fruit, but there was really nothing on offer. We ended up buying some snap peas.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401664535" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-2WwHhE0xUyE/Vky3VYEPHPI/AAAAAAAAfXs/_tq3-m5Ab5o/s288/P1490036.JPG" alt="20140601231535, "><span data-time="1401664535" class="timestamp"><p>We checked into our guesthouse and were given our room. This room is only six tatami mats large, but feels just fine to me. We went next door to the bath house to clean up. This time there was another man in the onsen. He turned out to be an Italian from Sud Tirol, and was on a nine month trip! We talked a little bit, but I was feeling a bit awkward being naked and all. I just need to grow up and get over it! The onsen water was hotter today than yesterday.</p><p>We also saw the pianist Ben and his father at the guest house. They liked our plan of doing the next 7km today and riding the bus tomorrow morning, so they put on their running clothes and had the hotel host drop them off up the road.</p><p>Tonight's lodge has a washer and dryer for guest use, so Katrina and I did a load of laundry while writing in our journals and waiting for dinner.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401672630" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-6pEypaLnOBY/Vky3VdKhOnI/AAAAAAAAfXk/ZRT2AQfWw2Y/s288/P1490039.JPG" alt="20140602013030, "><span data-time="1401672630" class="timestamp"><p>Dinner was served at 6:30 pm. All of the westerners were put in a room with western tables. The Japanese guests had their own dining room with tables on the floor.</p><p>I was pleasantly happy to hear that the restaurant would be able to accommodate my vegetarianism, as we thought tonight I would be served fish. Instead of the fish tempura we were served veggie tempura, and the chicken was left out of the fried rice. The other dishes included a salad with noodles and sesame dressing, cucumber and miso, fried eggplant, and the centerpiece dish was a large hotpot with tofu, mushrooms, cabbage and carrots. Our host said that the hotpot used "onsen water," which I take to mean that hot spring water was used.</p><p>We chatted a little with the other westerners, the pianist Ben and his father. They had booked their hike through a travel agency. They had fried fish from the local river as part of their dinner.</p><p>After dinner we looked over our maps for the coming hikes. Today we did approximately ten miles (16.3 km) of hiking. Tomorrow we have about six more hours in the schedule.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1401674198" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Eidf8sId3CM/Vky3Ven1k-I/AAAAAAAAfXs/UqJQdTdBkHg/s288/P1490045.JPG" alt="20140602015638, "><span data-time="1401674198" class="timestamp"><p id="endOfEntry">&lt;End of Journal&gt;</p></span>

<h2><a id="Luang Prabang to Siem Reap">Luang Prabang to Siem Reap</a></h2><h3><a id="1400828400">05/23/2014</a></h3><p>This morning we woke to an email from Marissa saying that the Thai Army was officially referring to its actions in Thailand as coup, and that a 10pm to 5am daily curfew has been placed on the Thai people. We did not have any plans for the day beyond packing and heading to the airport at noon, so we spent much of the morning investigating our options for our May 26 to 29 visit to Ko Samui, Thailand. We called our travel insurance via Skype, and learned that they have an exclusion on military coups. We checked the US Dept of State website and it basically told people to stay away from the protests. We checked flight costs between Siem Reap and Osaka, and found that there are one-stop options which are less than $500. The question is what would we do with the extra 4 days?</p><p>We considered spending more time in Cambodia and maybe going to a beach resort there, but it requires more flights. We considered going to Japan earlier, but we are not sure what to add to our time in Japan. I would like to add in a visit to Myanmar, but it feels ambitious. Another idea is to fly to an international hub city like Shanghai or Seoul or Hanoi and exploring a new city. Shanghai is tempting and will let travelers visit for 72 hours without a visa.</p><p>Ultimately though the only thing we are concerned about (at the moment) with regards to the coup is if the Bangkok airport will be closed. Ko Samui should be out of the way of any protests, so it is just our four flights via BKK which are at risk. In 2008 the protesters occupied the airport and closed it for eight days. It would make for a boring vacation to be stuck in the airport so long!</p><p>At this point we seem to be leaning towards keeping our Ko Samui itinerary.</p><p>We had breakfast at the hotel as usual, there were heart shaped waffles today. Just before next noon we checked out of the hotel and paid our tab, cleaning our wallets of all remaining kip. Ken showed up and took us the ten minutes to the airport.</p><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400878572" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-lHeps7iovMs/VkoaObZYmaI/AAAAAAAAfLc/Irp9SM3fUIg/s288/P1480015.JPG" alt="20140523205612, "><span data-time="1400878572" class="timestamp"><p>We chilled at the airport until about 1:45pm, when the finally boarded our Vietnam Airlines flight 931 to Siem Reap. The flight is two hours on a good sized propeller plane. We first circled around Luang Prabang, picking out landmarks way below, then headed south over the mountains which look like they have been covered in a patchwork quilt due to all the slash and burn farming. The farms dwindled for a short while then returned with strength to refill all of the window as we neared the Mekong the passed over the border into Thailand. Thailand is much more populated and full of farms roads and towns. The landscape changed a bit again once we were over Cambodia. Everything was still farmed, but the farmers had left a few big trees in each field.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400885193" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-op9M2YqPIj4/VkoaOeCbcZI/AAAAAAAAfLc/hz9-1-yeo4w/s288/P1480038.JPG" alt="20140523224633, "><span data-time="1400885193" class="timestamp"><p>We descended near the grand lake Tonle Sap and then turned back north towards the runway. The little farmsteads and villages below have only palm trees as their shade.</p><p>We landed in Siem Reap and applied for a Visa on Arrival. Each visa was US $20. Visas were processed by a line of nine immigration officials seated behind a sweeping counter. All tourists handed their paperwork and passports to the representative on the left of the counter, and he completed the one step or check for which he was responsible and then slid the papers/passport to the guy on his left. The process repeated until the passport arrived at the ninth official, who was on the far right of the counter and called out the name for the completed passport and visa.</p><p>We got our bags, dropped our customs declaration form into an unmanned box, and then went outside of the terminal to meet our driver. No one was there. We waited 30 minutes, then tried using the airport free wifi to call the contact number we had for ICS Cambodia. I was not able to get anyone to pick up. Frustrated, we hired a taxi for $7 to take us to the Golden Banana Boutique Resort.</p><p>Our taxi driver was Mr Sothea Chea. He is an English speaker and was clearly (but not obnoxiously) trying to sell us his driving and tour services for the remainder of our trip. He drove us ever-so-slowly into town, telling us about the hot weather, the tourist low season combined with problems in Thailand and Vietnam which are making life and work hard for many in Siem Reap, pointed out the King's local residence. When our path over the river and to the hotel was blocked by road construction he doubled back and used another bridge. Once over the river he found his route again blocked by a construction dumpster. Frustrated, he then drove one block in the wrong direction down the busy riverside parkway to the next block over. None of the oncoming traffic seamed fazed by this behavior. Traffic here, as in Nepal, seems to work on the principle that the biggest vehicle gets the right of way.</p><p>We made it to our hotel and then had to determine whether it was the Golden Banana Boutique Resort, Golden Banana Resort Hotel, or Golden Banana B&amp;B that held our booking. Katrina had expected that we would stay in a Deluxe Villa (Golden Banana Boutique Resort), but the hotel thought we would have a Standard Villa (Golden Banana Resort Hotel). After looking over email records we determined that the hotel was likely right, and then ICS had tried to book us a deluxe room but failed, so they booked us a standard room without highlighting for us the change.</p><p>The patient receptionist who helped us sort out the details then agreed to help us contact ICS and find our guide. He called the contact number we had on hand, and the people on the other end were ICS employees but they were off duty and not associated with our tour. Kat managed to get ICS Bangkok on email, and they sent us an updated set of contact numbers which were completely different from what we had originally. While the receptionist was waiting for a call back from the off duty ICS employee with further information, our guide Set turned up at the hotel. He introduced himself to us and said he had been at the airport with a paper and our names but that we must have not seen him. We were skeptical but did not press it. He then asked what our names were. (Katrina later realized that this question is a give away that he did not have a sign-board with our names at the airport.) We arranged to meet him at 8:30am to start our tour.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400894100" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-golpnhi5ttA/VkoaOUVsHpI/AAAAAAAAfLc/6wjNnjglNDI/s288/P1480047.JPG" alt="20140524011500, "><span data-time="1400894100" class="timestamp"><p>We settled into our Standard Villa. It is a two story room, but the AC is only on the first floor so the top story with its couch and TV are not so usable. We also have an upstairs balcony, which overlooks the courtyard and pool. The downstairs room has a weathered look to it with brown tile flooring red trim and doors, and stucco walls. It is comfortable enough, but not as polished as My Dream Resort.</p><p>Around sunset we left the hotel to find dinner at Khmer Kitchen, a dining location recommended by workmate of Katrina's. The first two blocks from our hotel towards the Old Market are local shops on a dirty dusty boulevard - bringing the "cleanliness" of Kathmandu to mind. Then, as we make it to the river, the street goes completely neon and becomes a tourist market.</p><p>Among the gift shops we found an ATM were we stopped to withdraw some local currency. We calculated our needs in USD and then multiplied by 4000 to approximate the local riel. But, when the ATM gave us the preset options for withdrawal amounts, they were all very low between 10 and 1000! Confused, we hit the button for a custom amount and saw that we were to put in a number of "$" desired. We entered US $70, and held our breaths to see what would be delivered. To my amazement USD came out of the machine. Cambodia really does seem to do business in USD.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400896647" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-2qcjPN-kPkg/VkoaOS0KyxI/AAAAAAAAfLc/6h0GBY3F4g0/s288/P1480055.JPG" alt="20140524015727, "><span data-time="1400896647" class="timestamp"><p>We crossed the river to the Old Market, dodged mopeds and cars to cross the street, and then found the Khmer Kitchen. The food here was fantastic (and only $4 per entree). We had a coconut curry with tangy tamarind flavor, and a Khmer soup with lemongrass, galangal, and kafir lime leaves that was spicy and sour too. From our table we watched tourists walk by and tried to guess where they came from.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400900405" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-AnQFukewvZk/VkoaOeNBvXI/AAAAAAAAfLc/cHq65oDLl7I/s288/P1480058.JPG" alt="20140524030005, "><span data-time="1400900405" class="timestamp"><p>After dinner we walked up and down the Old Market taking in the tourist scene. One alley was all restaurants, the next was all bars. Tuk-tuk drivers staked out every restaurant exit and tried to sell rides and people left the store. Other people approached us trying to sell tours. And whenever we stopped to glance at a restaurant or a fish foot massage parlor the shopkeeper would immediately jump to our sides and try to sell us his service. People must be really hungry for work here!</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1400900780" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-22I1PVBhijU/VkoaOfZ4PkI/AAAAAAAAfJw/R0o2O810IL8/s288/IMG_3878.JPG" alt="20140524030620, "><span data-time="1400900780" class="timestamp"><p>The Old Market feels as touristy as Monterey's Cannery Row, rowdy line Nashville's bar scene and as neon as Las Vegas. It is very familiar and very otherworldly all at the same time.</p><p>We came back to the hotel and swam in the pool. There was some lightning in the sky above so we went to bed.</p><p id="endOfEntry">&lt;End of Journal&gt;</p></span>

We showered under the lion's head faucet, then dressed and packed. We ventured out one more time to the wall top walk take in the many towers and turrets of the castle, and also views into town and up into the vineyard covered hills.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363617665" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-RoKtDlwmMKI/VhgrfR4kswI/AAAAAAAAJms/oUAHNRVURKk/s288/P1410945.JPG" alt="20130318144105, "><span data-time="1363617665" class="timestamp"><p>We moved our bags to the car and then explored the gardens around the castle. There is a (frozen) frog pond, a tree house, many terraces for sitting and relaxing, and spaces which look like they might serve for a wedding.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363619776" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Uwzh5uobEiI/Vhgr-N6012I/AAAAAAAAJrA/BHWefgbiiXA/s288/P1410985.JPG" alt="20130318151616, "><span data-time="1363619776" class="timestamp"><p>We ate breakfast in a smaller dining room. There were meats, fish, cheese, fruit, bread, pastry, muesli and yogurt available. I enjoyed putting the fresh goat cheese on the homemade pretzels. The apple cake and the egg on ratatouille were also good.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363623263" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-JS47tQG4NEo/VhgsElcTQOI/AAAAAAAAJr8/PO7zuPbM_I8/s288/P1410998.JPG" alt="20130318161423, "><span data-time="1363623263" class="timestamp"><p>We checked out and then set the GPS for Frankfurt airport. We started by cutting over the hills (and above the fog) to the autobahn. The car reported a traffic jam a few km down the highway, so we took a second short detour into wine country mid route. I hoped to do a little more high speed driving, but the derestricted portion of the autobahn was very short and a bit too trafficy; I only managed to hit 180kmh once.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363627871" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-YtgC8mPJl-E/VhgsHBtmyzI/AAAAAAAAJsU/No75P35DZVs/s288/P1420002.JPG" alt="20130318173111, "><span data-time="1363627871" class="timestamp"><p>We filled the car with gas and then returned it to Europcar. The final odometer reading was 2463km - so we traveled about 2200km this trip.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363634634" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-kj5uPVdA8D4/ViFjQQPPPVI/AAAAAAAAKOQ/qP7sjje-O8M/s288/IMG_20130318_072354.jpg" alt="20130318192354, "><span data-time="1363634634" class="timestamp"><p>We tootled around the airport until 12:50pm, when our flight Air Canada to Montreal boarded.</p></span><img title="Click to remove" class="thumbnail_timestamp" data-time="1363634662" style="" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ACUWgRKobOc/ViFjQXoYY9I/AAAAAAAAKOQ/F5i4A9rMFQc/s288/IMG_20130318_072422.jpg" alt="20130318192422, "><span data-time="1363634662" class="timestamp"><p id="endOfEntry">&lt;End of Journal&gt;</p></span>

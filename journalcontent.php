<h2><a name="Japan">Japan</a></h2>
<span class="timestamp" id="1255842304">
<h3><a name="091019">Oct 19-20, 2009</a></h3>

<p>
We got an early flight to Chicago, then connected to a JAL flight to Tokyo.  In Boston Logan, Kat bought maple syrup and “Boston” labeled chocolate bars as token gifts for Japanese hosts.
</p>
<p>
The Tokyo plane ride was 12.5 hours, just 1 hour more than the EWR->HNL flight we did one year ago.  I don’t know if I actually slept, but I had my eyes closed for 4 or 5 hours on the plane.  I also watched 3 movies, one “Summer Wars” was anime and was about a math Olympics kid that defeats an Army AI that is taking over Japan’s main internet service.  The food on the plane was two meals of mini fruit and green salads; the entrée was rice and mixed veggies.  Edible but not inspired.
</p>
<p>
Customs was straight forward and quick.  They did have IR video cameras looking for sick people with fevers.
</p>
<p>
We went looking for the phone rental shop SoftBank to get our rental cell phone.  On the way Kat dropped the bag of gifts – I brought “Mikes” pastries for Eric – and the maple syrup container broke.  Kat ended up covering one pant leg in syrup!  We got our phone, got cash, and then Kat realized that her cell phone was missing!  JAL was able to locate it quickly on the plane and return it to us.  Then we picked up our JR Rail passes and got on the airport Narita Express train to Tokyo station (a 1 hr trip), connected to the Yamamoto line to Nippori Station, and then a Joban line to Minami-Senju station.
</p>
<p>
The trains and stations are all orderly, logical, and efficient and have plenty of English signage to help us along.  The logic of the system makes the trains much less intimidating then was Moscow’s system.  In face, all of Japan seems more predictable and less scary than Russia.
</p>
<p>
-- Oh we also saw bamboo grove from the airport express.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1255972933">
<p>
From Minami-senju station, it was a ten minute walk to Kangaroo Hotel.  The hotel is all concrete, a bit like a barracks, but has friendly touches to make it more inviting.  Our room was largely filled with the futon mats, but also had a TV, fridge, and AC.  It was located in a quite street.  We had one set of slippers (size 7?) for the hotel, and others for the toilets.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1255980300">
<p>
Eric told us to meet him at Shinjuku Station at 8pm for dinner.  We got there early and people watched while waiting.  70% of the men dress in business suits – dark and often with pinstripes.  The women (especially the younger ones) wear much wider and wilder style of clothes.  They are mainly in skirts, but some are lacey, others plain, others have bright prints.  The most eye catching were two girls in pink puffy, Alice-in-Wonderland dresses with fairy-tale character patches stitched onto the fabric.  Kat called them “cupcakes.”  Another girl had sheet-music socks and a keyboard tie!  The ‘cool’ guys here have punk/pop style haircuts and logo t-shirts.
</p>
<p>
Eric was the 6th western person to be spotted and he took us out to the street. Big 10/story buildings were all lit up with neon lights advertising the various stores on each floor.  It was busy like Las Ramblas, lit like Vegas and very exciting.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256023915">
<p>
We ended up choosing an Onokomaki (spelling?) place where your table is a griddle and you order a bowl of batter + mochi or leeks + egg to stir and grill.  You gook it yourself!  We also had sake, which was poured into your glass until it overflowed onto the saucer, an expression of generosity and prosperity.  The griddle cake was decent, eaten with a sweet brown sauce on top.  Eric seems well, if scruffy and overworked.
</p>
<p>
After dinner Eric took us to a Toyobashi electronics store to buy a PS3.  The store probably has the square-footage of a Best Buy, but is chunked up over 6 floors.  The ceilings are lower and very brightly lighted, the store packed with electronics, games, etc.
</p>
<p>
On the trains we have been seeing many people playing Gameboys or cell phone games.  It is more popular here.  People have been checking us out on the trains, but we really don’t get that many looks.  I am mainly surprised by how homogeneous the population is – maybe I just don’t recognize the different Asian builds?  Or are they really all Japanese people?  We see white tourists every so often and black ones only twice.
</p>
<p>
After leaving Eric, we took showers at the hotel, washed our dirtiest clothes and went to sleep.
</p>
<p>
PS – we forgot to give Eric his gift!  Also, I saw two GT-Rs so far.
</p>

</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256107631">
<h3><a name="091021">10/21/09</a></h3>
<p>
We only slept until 6am (sunrise?).  All of the bird song is unfamiliar.  Like yesterday, today is warm; t-shirt weather!  Kat and I packed up and then headed out early for our Kyoto train.  We hit rush hour again, but our trains where boardable.  
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256110003">
<p>On one train we were able to watch the engineer.  He was in a uniform with white gloves and he had a pocket round, old-style watch placed in a special receptacle in the dash board.  At each station he would point his hand at the “go” light on the dash, then at the speed for the next rail segment, seemingly trying to anticipate when and which lights would appear.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256111271">
<p>
At Tokyo Station we exchanged our 10:30am rail pass for an 8:30 train Shinkansen Super Express to Kyoto.  We had middle seats booked on the left, but Kat had the good idea of boarding a non-reserved car and finding Mt Fuji side seats.  In the station I looked around for food and found egg salad sandwiches – white bread, no crust – and mochi adzuki sweet buns.  There were lots of bento boxes, but none that looked vegetarian.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256116892">
<p>
On the train haze kept us from seeing lots of Fuji, but Fuji was visible for maybe 20 minutes above the clouds.  Fuji has a very smooth and distinct profile, and has surprisingly little snow at this time of year!
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256118029">
<p>
Japan seems to be either flat or mountainous, and wherever it is flat is it fully developed.  The mountains on the other hand are not used at all.  In the flat we say dense population, scattered farming of crops – not animals – tea farms, orange fruit farms that are probably persimmons (we tried one later, it is good), city or factory, driving ranges.  We passed factories for Sony, Panasonic and a few other brands I recognized.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256126549">
<p>
It was maybe 2hrs to Kyoto, and then 3 stops north on the subway to Hotel Hearton.  We dropped off our packs at the front desk and then walked to the #17 bust stop by city hall.  At the bus stop there was an automated sign that indicated which buses were within 2 stops of arriving – very cool!
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256128734">
<p>
We took the bus to near Ginkaku-ji temple and then walked up to the temple.  Most impressive were the gardens.  The grounds are so well kept, with moss ground-cover and spaced trees.  We watched the gardeners sweep the moss clean and carry away fallen leaves.  The temple also has shaped stone/gravel gardens, forming cones and shaping stripes.  It is all perfectly precise.  The silver temple itself was under construction and only the 2nd floor was fully intact.  Still, from the hillside walking paths the temple roofs look nice.
</p>
<p>
I think Japanese gardens and especially the one at Ginkanku-ji really are my favorite type of garden.  I am not sure why!  The spacing, the water features, the enticing paths – I just like it!
</p>
<p>
Also in Ginkanku-ji we say a few Kimonoed people. Wearing kimono is more common in Kyoto than in Tokyo.  In general Kyoto dress is more causal than Tokyo – I am reminded of SF vs NYC.  The density and surrounding landscape also fits the SF vs NYC comparison.  
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256131847">
<p>
We then walked south along the Philosopher’s Path – a series of roads along a canal.  There are plenty of interesting eateries and a number that make you think Americans and Europeans are setting up shop in Kyoto.  The houses here are nice – not super upscale but very comfortable and in a good, quiet neighborhood.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256135138">
<p>
We walked to Reikan-ji thinking that we could find a multi-course tofu meal there, but then Kat remembered the tofu was actually by Nomura Museum and Tenju-an.  We found the place and sat in a traditional matted room, with open sliding rice-paper walls, looking at a pretty green garden.  The building looked old and crafted by skilled workmen.  Our waitress, in traditional dress, brought us sesame tofu, yam soup/porridge, tofu grilled with green sauce, tofu in hot water with seasonings, pickled veggies, rice, tempura including a tempura backed leaf, and tea.  My favorites were the green sauce tofu and the water tofu.  The waitress was kind enough to tell us what to eat and what to drink (yam stew).  It was a pleasant meal in a beautiful atmosphere.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256138529">
<p>
Next we back-tracked to Eikan-do and toured this large and still functioning complex.  The highlight here was the temple interiors, painted in bright colors, with geometric forms, nature scenes (waves or fire), or animals and mythical figures.  This temple is best known for its autumn colors, but we are just a bit too early to see more than a handful of red leaves.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256142361">
<p>
We continued south past Chion-an and Maruyama-koen to about Kodai-ji.  The neighborhood turned upscale with nicer restaurants and hotels, just across from Kodai-ji we walked back streets – “the prettiest in Kyoto” – filled with stone walls, old wood construction and waist high bamboo fencing,
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256145714">
<p>
We then went up to Gion and Shinbashi where we walked through the love district and along a pretty canal lined with private dining rooms.  Night had fallen (~6pm) and each restaurant had its own lighting to illuminate the water and better the view for customers.
</p>
<p>
The love district is not racy from the outside, but there are plenty of signs verbally offering girl bar this and companion that.  It was on the other side of the river near Pontacho where we say “Skank Disco” and more forward sex video options.  None of this is too racy to walk a child by though.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256149923">
<p>
Finally we walked through the Sanjo covered arcade and back to the hotel.  Here we cleaned-up, ogled the previews for the 500 yen pornos, ate our orange fruit and the convenience store sake, then retired.
</p>
<p>
Kyoto is a comfortable and interesting city!  We must have seen five distinct styles of neighborhood, three or four restaurants with veggie food and a gazillion temples today!  There is so much we could see here, but we will be gone before we know it.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256198704">
<h3><a name="091022">10/22/09</a></h3>
<p>
We got an early start, grabbed adzuki pastery and yogurt from a combini on the run and took the bus to Ryoan-ju and its rock zen garden.  We were some of the first on the premises and enjoyed the rocks with about three other western tourists.  Mainly I thought about how to rake the garden so as not to leave any footprints and I noticed how the rocks were like islands in the sea – perhaps it took an islander’s mentality to come up with such a garden?
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256203165">
<p>
Next we walked over to Kinkaku-ju, which was packed even though it was only 9:15am.  The highlight here is the Golden Temple on the edge of a beautiful lake.  We could not enter the temple but saw pictures of its interior and its reflective (pool-like) floors!  We had a student (here were many schools visiting) take a picture of us giving the peace sign like all the cool (Japanese) kids do.  Also on the grounds were some concession stands giving tastes of treats.  I had mochi green tea balls and fruit-filled mochi ravioli that were both very good.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256208400">
<p>
We bussed it down to the imperial gardens where the Costumes of the Ages parade was about to start.  Some kind elderly ladies gave us their front row tickets – the sun was too hot for them.  Our seats where on blankets rolled out on the gravel street.  The Japanese would remove their shoes before walking on to the mats.  We watched the parade close up.  There were lots of swords and beaded armor.  Some troupes did dance routines and passed tall polls back and forth.  Others pushed carriages by.  I could not tell one era’s costumes from the next, and grew bored.  We left after an hour.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256218687">
<p>
For lunch we ate at Biote, a five table 2nd floor establishment with whole foods focus and a veggie menu.  We got our first miso soup of the trip and generally enjoyed the food!  It kinda reminded me of Veggie Planet for its scrappy tables and small dining area.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256221434">
<p>
Next we walked to Nishikakoji-dori food market.  There were lots more mochi foods, rice cakes, fish dried and fresh, pickles, fruit, and candy to be seen.  We sampled the free tastes, but only Kat bought a rice cake.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256225691">
<p>
We took the trains to the north to see the Kurama Fire Festival.  We got off one station earlier than Kurama as the guide book mentioned that you could walk to the “impossibly quaint” Kibune (20 min) and then hike over the mountain to the temples above Kurama (30 min).  Unfortunately, it was more like 35 min to Kibune and I was worried our light would fade before we reached Kurama.  Our map was not the clearest, the signage was only in Japanese and there were multiple paths through the forest.  The smart/safe move would have been to turn around and get back on the train, but Kat was already on edge for getting bad information from the guide book and for my worrying about the sunset.  Hikers coming down the Kibune-Kurama woods trail suggested we needed 1 hour to complete the hike, and we only had 40 minutes of good light left.  For all the wrong reasons we went for it anyway, climbed the steep mountain side .8km, then descended into Kurama’s temples.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256231289">
<p>
Actually, watching the mountain sunset from the highest temple complex was very beautiful.  There are serious hills around here!  The temple altar was dark, but punctuated by lanterns that made it look starry.  The walk down the stairs from the temple was lined with lit rice lanterns, and we passed a massively thick redwood tree too!
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256233413">
<p>
In Kurama, we were confused about were the action was, and burnt 30 min at the fire source cul-de-sac, which was not on the parade route.  When we decided to leave, we were funneled into a flow of people walking up the main road and away from the trains!  In the road, parading children and adults were carrying large lit torch bundles and chanting.  Some of the torches were as large as people; we think even bigger ones would be lit later in the night.  We did not really follow the ceremony.  Some young men wore loin cloths showing off their butts.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256246673">
<p>
After enduring a thick return line to the train, we returned to Kyoto, ate Indian food for dinner at a place next to a Red Sox bar, bumped into some Americans in the restaurant, and finally retired. 
</p>

</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256286314">
<h3><a name="091023">10/23/09</a></h3>
<p>
We tried the breakfast buffet – a mix of western foods like eggs and cornflakes plus miso soup, rice and veggies – then got on the slow train (76 minutes vs 45 minutes) to Nara.  The pedestrian drag to Nara’s park complex is much more run-down/haphazard than anything else we have seen so far.  We entered the park by the 5-story pagoda, and then walked over to Tojidai, the world’s largest wood building and home to a huge Buddha statue!  Along the way we passed throngs of Japanese school groups of all ages, each group in its particular costume usually with matching hats, and we also saw our first of the 100 Nara deer.  <editorial>There were probably many more deer than that! </editorial>
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256293336">
<p>
The deer can be fed 150 yen cookies sold by venders.  We watched others buy these cookies and get the deer to chase them around looking for a treat.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256294492">
<p>
More on the school kids – we say kindergarteners to high schoolers.  The kinders wore bright hats, matching shirts and shorts, and walked in two lanes, one for boys and the other for girls, holding hands.  The bright outfits continued until middle school, when the kids would transition into suits and skirts.  Boys would all either be in Eastern suits or Western suits, some times in dark slacks and white shirts instead.  Girls wear dark sweaters over light blouses.  Their skirts are often knee length dark plaid, sometimes hiked up to mini-skirt cut.  I think these skirts are like catholic school skirts.  Additionally the girls have long dark blue socks.  They personalize the socks by embroidering a small icon on the top.  The Playboy Bunny icon seems most usual!  <editorial>Some times a school group would be a sports team, and all of the students would be in their sports uniforms. </editorial>
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256294864">
<p>
In Todai-ji there are three buddhas.  The huge central one is golden and ringed with mini-buddhas in a halo like form.  The two flanking buddhas are 60% of the main one’s size.  Also inside is the statue of a furious looking warrior.  <editorial>He had similar form to the furious warriors that typically guard the gates to temples.  These warriors are built into the gatehouse on either side of the entrance.  Todai-ji had a pair too as you entered the enclosure wall of the temple area. </editorial>
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256296117">
<p>
We watched school school girls pushing themselves through the peg hole in the bottom of a large support pillar, then pausing half way through to make peace signs and have their pictures taken by friends on the exit side.  <editorial>Passing through this peg hole in the Todai-ji temple is supposed to be like passing through the nostril in the large Buddha.  If you make it through, you get a form of good luck. </editorial>
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256297547">
<p>
Next we walked a loop through the park.  We went up towards the Kasauba Taisha shrine, which has hundreds of lanterns around on the sides of the walkways.  The lanterns are sometimes three rows deep!  This all was in the forest – I may have seen Japanese redwoods – and was very beautiful.  <editorial>In the shrine, we paused to watch some sort of formal ceremony.  The participants were in formal dress and I wondered if it might be a wedding. </editorial>  We continued south to find the Isui-en gardens.  Along the way we stopped to buy a yam from the yam vender-lady.  These ladies have wood fired yam carts to cook the yams.  It was pricy!  Yams are sold by weight and our cost almost 8000 yen!  The yam was closer to potato in consistency and sweetness than it was to sweet potatoes I am familiar with.  
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256302050">
<p>
<editorial>Upon approaching the Isui-en gardens we got confused because there were two garden entrances side by side.  The closer garden turned out not to be Isui-en, but it was free to tourists so we looked around.  It was pretty by a bit wild for Japanese standards, with the grass patchy and the woods unmanicured. </editorial>
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256302929">
<p>
The real Isui-en gardens are very beautiful; the first side has a public teahouse/eatery looking over a smaller densely foliaged pond.  <editorial>The thickness of growth on this side made feel wilder. </editorial>  The second side has a larger, more open pond, with a Windows XP-esque grassy hill on one bank, a small waterwheel, stepping stone rocks to get to an island in the pond, tow small tea houses on the other shore.  This was all exceedingly beautiful, and I took many photos.  <editorial>Even though this garden is in the city center, it was constructed so that the foliage and walls block out all sight of the surrounding buildings, and the vantage points that remain to areas outside the garden walls only show the natural hilly landscapes on the city’s edge.  This makes the garden feel like it is in the country, not the city. </editorial>
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256305581">
<p>
Our last Nara visit was to an old house in a residential neighborhood.  The first floor was low ceilings and matted floors, the second floor had vaulted ceilings and hardwood floors.  It was nice and more spacious than I expected.
</p>

<p>
We took the train back to Kyoto, scrambled to get our bags from the hotel and then returned to the train station.  We boarded the first Shenkansen to Nagoya, arrived at Nagoya and then started looking for a connecting train to Takayama.  <editorial>We had been in contact with Eric during the day, and expected we would arrive in Takayama after him.</editorial>  As we were asking the station staff for directions, we saw Eric looking for the ticket line too!
</p>

<p>
All three of us made it onto the same train to Takayama, which left moments after we boarded.  We presented Eric with his tired and overdue Mike’s pastries.  On the ride Eric and I talked over my questions about Japan.  <editorial>Our train left after 8pm, so it was dark the whole way and we could not see the mountains we were climbing through.</editorial> 
</p>

<p>
In Takayama, we checked into our temple – which is much more like a hostel and is teaming with English speaking tourists.  Our room is a Japanese-style room with three futons on a mat floor.  The room is on the garden hallway that overlooks a small Japanese garden and pond.
</p>

<p>
Dinner was at a nearby Japanese bar.  The establishment had an English menu and extensive letters of recommendation from previous visitors.  Inside it was a three table establishment manned only by the cook.  Kat and I ordered veggie tempura and a roasted eggplant with miso sauce.  The eggplant was very good and was eaten by chopsticking the meat out of the center.  <editorial>In fact, this eggplant would become my favorite Japanese meal of the trip!</editorial>
</p>

<p>
Back at the temple, Eric showed us how to use the butane heater to warm the room.  The heater stinks!  We ended up just using the electric blankets instead.

We woke up before 7:30am, took showers and then crossed the street to the coffee house for breakfast.  We almost did not enter the shop because of all the smoking inside, but one of the patrons cleared a space for us at his table so we felt obligated.  The southern wall of the place was a counter where the hostess/cook worked and where a few people could eat, the northern wall had 3 or 4 tables for patrons.  The western wall was a bookshelf of manga!
</p>

<p>
The customers were all men, all over 50, and most smoking and reading manga.  One man might have been reading a porn magazine!  (Eric says that porn here has to blur out the loins, but that he has seen men reading porn and masturbating on the subway!) Kat and I ordered egg sandwiches which were very good.  They were toast with mayo, lettuce, eggs and cucumbers.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256379905">
<p>
The car rental was just a few blocks away, and we got the Mazda Demio just after 9:15am.  Here in Japan many of the car manufactures also run rental outlets.  Since we did not remember which of the villages we wanted to see, Kat and I returned to the temple for a Google search while Eric bought a map.  We determined we wanted to see Ogimachi, Ainokura and Sugunuma, three villages known for their wood construction house with straw roofs of 1 meter thickness.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256382664">
<p>
After some mis-starts and wrong turns we made to the Sheregawago stop off the expressway.  <editorial>Here we toured a reproduction of the famous wood and straw houses, and looked over their huge selection of gift foods.</editorial>  Eric introduced us to corn on the cob with a salty Japanese sauce.  The closest village was Ogimachi.  We went up to a hillside overlook and looked down on the town.  Then entered Ogimachi and we walked among the houses, which are interspersed between rice and veggie fields.  All of the mountains in the area are in full fall color, mostly showing oranges and yellows.  The mountains are quite tall and remind me of the Alps for their steepness, though not height.  There were some many tourists in town that it was a bit of a zoo, but we toured a traditional house.  The house was five stories high!  And it was smoky all the way through from its open hearth cooking fire.  The house owner said the smoke actually cures the straw roof and helps it last an extra 10 years!  In the house we also saw silkworm farming tools.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256391216">
<p>
We ate lunch at a soba noodle shop that makes its own noodles fresh.  Then we toured the rest of the town, admiring the rainbow trout in the street side gutters, trying grilled mochi balls.  Eric went food/treat shopping for his workmates because he was feeling guilty for not working on the weekend of a deadline.  <editorial>However, we had made plans with him before the deadline was known, so he came along with us anyway.  The treat shops that he was exploring were very numerous, and had local variety food items that you might not be able to find in other towns.</editorial>  
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256397501">
<p>
We then went north to the other villages, which were much smaller and less mobbed.  Ainokusa was nestled into the mountains.  The highway to Ainokusa was a twisty line strung along a dammed canyon.  I got to drive the canyon and enjoyed the scenery and the car’s ride, even if the Mazda’s steering was not as precise as I had hoped.  <editorial> Ainokusa itself was much smaller than Ogimachi, with only one quarter of the houses and just one main street.  It was on a hillside rather than in a river valley like Ogimachi.</editorial>
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256404485">
<p>
We drove back to Takayama, and Eric tried to find a 7-11 so he could get cash.  Alas, there are no 7-11s in town!  For dinner we ate stir fried veggies at a Chinese restaurant.  Eric said his pork subuta was the best he had ever had.  Our food was just good.
</p>

<p>
Back at the temple, we all tried the pitch dark passage under the alter, trying to find the “key” to enlightenment.  Strangely the key is actually a lock!  Go figure…
</p>

<p>
Mazda Demio driving impressions!  Driving right-hand drive isn’t terribly hard, though at first I was tempted to put the far left side of the car into the ditch, just to be sure I was on the left side of the road.  Once I was on the big roads I could overcome that issue.  I did not make any mistaken turns into oncoming traffic, though each intersection required more attention.  The most different aspect was the mirror placement.  I am not used to glancing up and left for the rear-view mirror.  As such, I often felt like I was driving without rear vision.
</p>

<p>
Alas, I did not get to attack the spaghetti  roads through the mountains.  The roads we were on have low posted speed limits, and the locals seem to drive 30kph over the limits.
</p>

<p>
Cars spotted today: a new GT-R, Evo X, Evo IX, Civic Type-R, 911 Turbo, 993, several STIs.
</p>

</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256458002">
<h3><a name="091025">10/25/09</a></h3>

<p>
Today we started by stopping at the station to book tickets back to Tokyo (via Nagoya).  We got a 12:40 train which gave us time to explore Takayama before departing.  Being cash conscious as Eric was out of money and we were running low, we ate breakfast in a coffee house near to the train station.  The coffee house was again filled with Japanese customers, and had three tables plus counter service.  On the walls were squid puppets, a stuffed animal Kitty Kat, and paintings of horses.  I ordered an “eggo toasto” which turned out to be egg salad this time around.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256463974">
<p>
After breakfast we walked over to the riverside street market.  People were selling crafts and food; we sampled sesame brittle, mochi chunks and rice crackers.  I bought some chili spices <editorial>for Mom</editorial> - we have seen chili peppers growing in this area.  There were also nice wood crafts and textiles on display.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256465948">
<p>
We left the market and headed for the old house district.  Kat and I toured a house while Eric waited outside.  The house was large, with six or seven rooms on the ground floor and maybe five rooms upstairs.  It, like many other places we have seen, had an interior garden that could be looked from the house’s core corridor that connected the rooms.  <editorial>This is the same setup that our temple lodging has.</editorial>  The house was built in 1860 and used both glass and rice paper windows.  It had an open hearth kitchen in the tall, two-story roof section of the house.  After the self-guided tour, we were given tea and a rice cracker.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256468210">
<p>
We continued on with Eric to a nearby temple.  In the temple plaza was a flower show with bonsai trees.  Also near the temple was a rock shrine with two characters on its face.  Eric surmised that if you trace those characters with a pen or brush then leave the pen at the shrine, you will have increased study ability.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256469509">
<p>
We started walking back to the temple lodge via some of the more picturesque streets of Takayama.  These streets had traditional wood faced and paper windowed stores.  They were separated from the street by oversized, deep gutters carrying flowing water.  Some stores were restaurants, but most sold food and other gifts.  After leaving the shopping district, I say a new GT-R parked in someone’s driveway – houses in this area must be more expensive than they appear!
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256475019">
<p>
This time on the train to Nagoya we had daylight and could enjoy the scenery.  The trip was two and a half hours long, with almost two hours spent descending out of the mountains.  We started by going though a few broad valleys filled with farms, homes and rice fields.  Then we ended up following a steep river gorge.  The water had that alpine blue-green color, and had cut a deep valley into the rocky earth.  We got the feeling that Japan is making the most of its water, as the rivers are dammed again and over again, and the river water feed the ever present rice fields and veggie gardens.
</p>

<p>
On the way down I also spotted two red nosed baboons dashing along the side of the highway!  <editorial>Eric says people mainly think of the monkeys as pests.</editorial>
</p>

<p>
The mountains got steeper as we descended, and started looking like those that appear on Japanese screen art surrounded by clouds.  I cannot imagine any army passing through these mountains prior to roads.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256481989">
<p>
Down in the valley near Gifu, we left the mountains behind for urban sprawl.  We still saw lots of rice farms, some yet to be harvested.  It occurred to me that this farm/city mix is a realization of an idea that is so popular in the US today, local food.  We also say a few cows, the first livestock we have spotted on this trip.  
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256483172">
<p>
In Nagoya I was surprised by the raciness of the women.  We exited the train station so Eric could get cash at a 7-11, then walked to the huge 13 story department store attached to the station to find food.  Walking to the department store, we accosted a Japanese kid with a Dartmouth hat.  He clearly had never been to our school.  The department store was floor after floor of expensive shopping topped by two floors of restaurants.  We tried the cheaper Indian restaurant that had a veggie lunch menu.  Eric and I ordered off the “lady’s” menu!  The food was just ok – hot without flavor.  The checkout girl spoke English and when she learned that Katrina attends Harvard she was very impressed and said, “you must be very smart!”
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256487585">
<p>
We caught the return train to Tokyo.  On the train an Italian family was trying to work out with some Japanese women whose seats where whose.  I was able to use a few words of Italian to help explain, while Eric worked the Japanese end.
</p>

<p>
Eric disembarked before us and we bid him farewell.  Maybe we will meet him for dinner later this week.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256497411">
<p>
We found our hotel “Rose Garden” near Shinjuku station, then washed all of our accumulated dirty laundry and took showers.  For dinner we stopped in the 7-11 and got a soba bowl, a rice sushi, some pickles, rice crackers and Kit Kats.  <editorial>Eric has a friend that swears Japanese Kit Kats are better than those in the rest of the world.</editorial>  Apparently eating at 7-11 is how Eric survives in Tokyo without cooking, and also how many Japanese Tokyo residents eat too.  The checkout boy here at 7-11 was very helpful and even microwaved our soba dish before we left.  Overall the meal was tastier than lunch!
</p>

<p>
Here are some small things I have noticed about Japan.  Bathrooms here do not have hand towels.  The seats on the trains can rotate to face the other direction.  Train platforms have markings for each train door and you line up for a particular door before the train arrives.  Porno magna magazines are sold out in the open at 7-11.  Upscale toilets include seat warming.  Only Japanese children stare at us.  Even non-tea shops give out tea to potential customers.  There are a lot more gift shops with regional gifts that in the US.  Manhole covers are specialized per city.  Even Q-Tips have individual wrapping.  You get hot washcloths before each meal.  Only soft serve ice cream stores abound, and most stores serve green tea ice cream.  There are heating shelves for drinks better served hot in “combini” like 7-11.  Further, ice tea tastes just like tea, and is not sweetened.  In the JR rail station platform, they play 20 second jingles whenever a train arrives.  The stations also play bird song – perhaps it is a distress call to scare away the birds?  Many Tokyoers look tired.  No tipping is required anywhere!  Lots of people wear surgical masks.
</p>

</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256539652">
<h3><a name="091026">10/26/09</a></h3>

<p>
We got up at 5am to go to the Tokyo Fish Market.  Our 6:30am arrival was after the biggest bustle of the day, but there was still plenty of fish to see.  The largest fish were frozen tuna (I think) that were as big as our backpacking packs!  The fish merchants were using band saws to cut the frozen tuna into smaller pieces.
</p>

<p>
The market was not as I had imagined.  I though it would be like a farmer’s market, where each vendor had a long, slanted stand covered in ice with nice cuts of fish presented.  Instead, there were rows and rows of stacked Styrofoam boxes, each packed with fish and ice.  Some venders had their fish/crabs/mollusks/squid/turtles live in tanks or buckets of water.  Kat and I were both most moved by the live turtles, and wanted to purchase them and set them free.  The eels and other wormlike fish were the grossest, though I also had a bit of a hard time with the venders slaughtering the live fish.
</p>

<p>
The market was in a big warehouse.  We walked down one row from one end to the other and probably passed 100 venders.  In total there may have been 10 or 20 rows of this length!
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256543473">
<p>
Next we headed to the Tokyo Auto Show.  We were there at 9am, one hour early, and spent most of the time waiting in line talking with the security guard (masayuki omori) for my ticket window.  The guard had lived in New Hampshire for 10 years, went to Southern NH University, and clearly missed the USA.
</p>

<p>
When the car show opened, I was the first in line for my ticket window.  I got inside and literally ran to the far right hand corner of the convention center, where the test drives line was located, hoping to get a drive in the Nissan GT-R.  <editorial>I was not the only one with this hope, dozens of other young men were also running of for the line.  When I arrived I was maybe 50th in line.</editorial>  Alas, a screener turned me away from the test drive line because I don’t understand Japanese.  
</p>

<p>
Instead we looked at the cars on the floor.  The most interesting were the Honda CR-Z, the Toyota FT-86 and the Lexus LF-A.  I also saw a Lamborghini Gallardo Valentino Balboni special edition.  Katrina’s favorite car was a Mazda concept car with flowing, windy styling.  We were both amused by the Toyota string quartet playing electric violins and basses.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256565327">
<p>
Katrina and I had hoped to buy Mitsubishi hats as gifts, so we asked the Mitsubishi booth representatives were we could find hats for sale. We were sent to Mitsubishi Motors headquarters in downtown Tokyo.  While the hats they had on hand were uninspiring <editorial>- I just wanted a simple hat with the propeller symbol, not a bunch of sponsorship writing - </editorial> we did find some $15 shirts that we liked.  I started trying it on and the sales woman kindly brought over a mirror so I could see how it looked on me.  Then a senior salesman came by and asked us if the shirts cost too much.  Considering that everything else in the store was in the $40 to $120 range, I (smoothly – not!) replied no, then reconsidered and asked him if he could reduce the price.  He said how about $10 per shirt.  Then, without prodding decided to sell us the two shirts for $10 total!  <editorial>I will keep one for myself as a souvenir and the other will be given to Katrina’s brother Alex.</editorial>  Next he offered me a test drive of the MiEV.  I took him up on it and we went around the block (all lefts) in the steady typhoon rain of the day.  The MiEV is <editorial>a very narrow city car that fits 4 or 5 people and is </editorial> actually a nice drive.  My only gripe is that the brakes could stop quicker at the top of the stroke.  Mitsubishi claims a 100 mile range to this electric car.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256570258">
<p>
We went to Harajuku to find lunch at Momonoki, an organic restaurant.  <editorial>We had a bit of difficulty locating the entry to the basement restaurant, but we eventually did find it.</editorial>  The restaurant was playing classical music and had a dark atmosphere <editorial>with most of the low tables slung along the longest wall of the place.</editorial>  The menu was an extensive list of vegetable and tofu dishes.  I ordered udon with seven types of vegetables – this meant that I had a plate with two bites each of carrots, radish, leaks, daikon radish, lotus root and two other veggies I cannot remember!  Katrina had the same seven veggies with her ginger soy tofu steak.  The food was good, though we both could have eaten more.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256572812">
<p>
We walked back through Harajuku in the heavy rain.  <editorial>Harajuku is know for the fashion trend it has spawned – gothic blacks and whites juxtaposed by fairyland frilly pinks.  The area has a bit of a Haight Street feel to it too, as there are crystal and alternative lifestyle shops around.  No drugs though…</editorial>  I tried to take pictures of the more unusually dressed girls on the street.  Some of the girls were still in school uniform, others dressed smartly, others wearing checker pattern stockings with dresses or skirts.  The shops in the this district had a lot of phony American clothing, with often nonsensical messages.  Kat and I tried looking for funny shirts as souvenirs.  I did not find any knockout shirts that I liked and Katrina found that Japanese clothing sizes are too small for her.  We passed lots of second hand clothing and plaid clothing too.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256579025">
<p>
We returned to our hotel so that Kat could change out of her sandals and skirt –she was freezing in today’s nonstop cold rain and was also getting all sorts of looks from the locals <editorial>(for her shoes?)</editorial>!
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256581969">
<p>
We then went to Akihabara, the electronics district of Tokyo.  We walked through a small section of stalls selling electrical components like resistors and capacitors.  Then we crossed the main street to the side with the big electronics stores.  Store fronts alternated between software, hardware, grabby-claw arcades where you could win towels, pillows or figurines of suggestively posed anime women!  On the second floors of some buildings were the “maid cafes” where you could be served tea and food by girls dressed as maids.  The maids were also on the street hawking their respective cafes.  <editorial>I tried to take a photograph of one of these girls, but she was clearly not interested and moved out of the way of my shot.</editorial>  We went into several electronics stores, purchased SD cards for our cameras and checked out a display of robots.  <editorial>I was disappointed that these robots were just toys for play, and not robots that could household chores and the like.</editorial>  We walked around a small arcade which had pods that emulate the cockpit of a Mech warrior.  Again, there were copious amounts of anime, anime porn and real porn in street level shops.  We saw a shop window with a display of “boy-love” <editorial>(homosexual boy love stories)</editorial> manga which Eric says is marketed to and read by Japanese girls.
</p>

<p>
I am still confused as to why Japanese girls will publicly walk around dressed like anime characters from anime porn.  I guess it is to attract the attention of boys, but it seems so gutsy to take what I see as dress for the bedroom onto the street.  I also find it hard to believe that the dress-up is just for the boys, as some of the costumes look like tea party outfits for little girls.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256588178">
<p>
For dinner we went to Ebisu.  In a shopping plaza nearby to the station, we took the elevator up to the 39th floor of a tower to look out over the cloudy, rainy city.  It looked like the nightscape from a futuristic video game, with the ever continuing towers trailing off into the night and the fog.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256589860">
<p>
We met Eric at Ebisu station and then went to Zest Mexican Cantina.  I had veggie enchiladas that were not spicy at all<editorial> - Japanese food in general is not so spicy</editorial>.  Eric told us hour after getting home on Sunday he worked until 3am!  Our waiter was French and spoke English fine, but a French waiter seemed strange for a Mexican restaurant.
</p>

</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256631530">
<h3><a name="091027">10/27/09</a></h3>

<p>
Today we started by walking around some of the Shinjuku towers and going up to the observation floors.  <editorial>We tried the closest open tower to our hotel, but we could only get views towards Mt Fuji.  We stopped in a nearby luxury hotel and asked if any of the other skyscrapers had observation floors, and were told that the dual government towers across the road were open to the public.</editorial>
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256638742">
<p>
The best views were from the South tower of the government building.  We could see clearly to Mt Fuji, which was clear except for a small bit of the east slope which had clouds.  Even though it was far away, Fuji-san was impressive in its snowcapped glory.  Some other photographers in the tower told us that we were very lucky today – they had lived in Tokyo for 15 years and had not seen clear skies to Fuji even once!  
</p>

<p>
We could also see other mountains in the far distance, ringing around greater Tokyo at a distance of maybe 40 miles away.  In between Shinjuku and the southern and western ranges of mountains was think cityscape but not many skyscrapers.  However, to the east and north the huge towers in Shibuya and other business hubs could be seen.  There are so many towers spread over a vast area, making me think that Tokyo is the largest city I have seen.  The flatness of the area has certainly helped the city borders grow. 
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256642687">
<p>
<editorial> To encourage visitors to enjoy nature, someone had created a cardboard tree trunk that you could climb into.  Inside were aromatic wood chips.  A sign on the tree told visitors “Please go inside this tree.  It smells tree and make you comfortable.”</editorial>
</p>

<p>
We had purchased postage stamps on the way to the government towers, and we mailed off a batch of postcards to family, friends and coworkers.  I tried to send a card to each coworker who is helping me out while I am away on this trip.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256645291">
<p>
We walked through Shinjuku, passed the train station and on the other side entered the Isetan department store.  Department stores in Japan are like Harrods or the Corte Ingles in Spain.  They are huge multistory buildings selling everything you could think of!  In Isetan we headed to the basement in search of a picnic lunch.  The whole floor was filled with prepared food vendors, 80% of which were Japanese foods or sweets of one type or another.  The remaining 20% was western foods like Italian and French baked goods.  Most food was very expensive, but in the end we found vegetarian bento boxes containing brown rice, white rice, cooked carrots, seaweed, sweet green beans, corn salad, tempura, mushrooms, cooked radish and yam, fried tofu, and a few other items I cannot remember!  Each item had maybe two or three bites worth of food.  The box itself was Styrofoam, two tiers high and adorned with flowery patterns.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256647494">
<p>
We took our food into Shinjuku-Gyoen Park (entrance fee required) and walked around looking for a lunch spot.  Like Central Park, in many places skyscrapers could be seen above the trees.  There were wooded areas, a string of ponds and Japanese gardens, and French gardens too which we did not visit.  Also in the park was an infestation of large 1.5” spiders which created big webs in the trees!  We saw a turtle crossing the path too.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256649294">
<p>
We picked a lunch spot in a grassy meadow far away from the spider trees and enjoyed the food in the bento boxes.  The wind kept blowing our trash across the meadow and I would have to sprint to collect it.  We also finished the Pocari Sweat drink which we had purchased based on name alone.  I think it tasted more like Airborne vitamin fizz tablets than it did like sweat.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256653661">
<p>
We left the park and took the Metro to Ginza.  We walked from the shopping towers in Ginza to the Imperial Palace Park via Hibiya Park.  Ginza was similar to the other tower filled stops in Tokyo, though things were slightly cleaner and the streets broader.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256654003">
<p>
Hibiya Park and the Imperial Palace Park were most striking for the huge fortress walls and moats that contained the parks.  The moat must have been 50’ wide, filled with water and the steeply inclined walls were straight and substantial, maybe 40’ tall and made of large cut boulders.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256655008">
<p>
The palace itself is behind additional perimeters of fortress wall and is not visible except for one small building.  This building can be seen behind two bridges crossing the inner moat, and is of Japanese style.  Looking away from the park core towards Tokyo station, one sees financial towers along broad boulevards.  In some aspect the walks of the compound and the exterior parade grounds are like the Kremlin.  The difference is that there is more space between the imperial center and the city beyond.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256656840">
<p>
We boarded the subway again and when to Asakusa, Tokyo’s old town neighborhood.  The attraction here is the Senso-ji temple.  The walkways/streets up to the temple are filled with tourist shops.  We got mango soft-serve ice cream, then fried sweet bean balls, then found some nice fabric squares that I will give to Mom.  We also visited a shrine to the raccoon dog.  The Japanese say that this prankster spirit uses his testicles to fly!
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256660553">
<p>
The Senso-ji temple gate is the oldest surviving (unreconstructed) part of the temple and is beautiful in its traditional white and red color scheme.  In the gate hangs a huge lantern and nearby to the left was a four or five story pagoda that was pretty and clean in the glow of the setting sun.  (Sunset is around 5:20pm.)  The temple itself was under renovation and could not really be seen behind the scaffolding.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256661718">
<p>
Walking back to the Metro, we checked out more of the tourist shops.  There were some beautiful fabric stores.  Katrina like the idea of giving chopsticks as gifts, but acknowledged that her family would never use them.  We tried out a shiny orange rice-flour ball and some bean paste cookies.  Neither treat was great in my opinion.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256666471">
<p>
We took the Metro to Shibuya to find the huge crosswalk that fills with people every 30 seconds.  People pour into the corners of this crossing from the train station and from four surrounding streets full of stores.  When the crosswalk light clears, people flood into the road from all directions.  We went into a 2nd story Starbucks to watch the action.
</p>

<p>
Shibuya is the most peopled section of Tokyo we have visited.  It was completely overwhelming to be in its noise and crowds.  Our guidebook spoke of a vegetarian restaurant in Shibuya, so we went looking for it.  <editorial>We walked the block it should have been in without finding it, so we then ducked in to a combini for directions.  The combini manager pulled out a thick booklet of street maps, that looked a little like a city-planners set of blueprints.  Each building on each block was outlined and numbered.  The combini manager confirmed that we were looking at the correct block, so we assume the restaurant has gone out of business.</editorial>
</p>

<p>
We ended up going into the nearby department store basement to find food for dinner.  We got mango smoothies (a Japanese large is like an American small) and salads.  We returned to our hotel to pack and sleep.  Eric had invited us out for drinks, but we were so tired from our big day that we declined his offer.  It turned out to be a good thing too, because one of the many thinks I ate this afternoon made me sick and I threw up my mango smoothie!  After, I rallied a little, packed my bag and slept.

<p>
We got up at 5:30 am to make our 6:35 am Narita Express.  At the airport we returned our rental cell phone and looked for ways to spend our last yen.  Katrina got some rice crackers and some mochi ‘ravioli’ like those that we saw in Kyoto.
</p>

<p>
As our flight taxied away from the gate, the ground crew stood in a line facing the plane.  First, they all bowed in unison.  Then, as we drove away they all waved at us until we were out of sight.  Fantastic!
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256729519">
<p>
On our flight, we crossed Japan and may have very well flown over the mountains near Takayama.  I saw to the west of the city that was probably Takayama a large reservoir and to the east many tall snowcapped mountains.  Much of the Japanese mountains are deep reed with fall color.
</p>

<p>
We crossed some water and then flew over South Korea.  There seemed to be more green-space in Korea, as opposed to the many farms that consume Japan.
</p>

<p>
Between Korea and China the cloud cover (smog?) started to thicken.  It was not until we were five minutes away from landing in Beijing that we were low enough to see the buildings on the ground.  Many of the buildings are cookie-cutter apartments.  We also crossed several highways, including one that was still under construction.
</p>

<p>
<editorial>Katrina and I were worried about being quarantined by Chinese health officials.  We had heard about health checkpoints in the airport that looked for sick travelers and locked you up in a hospital for two weeks if they thought you were ill!  We had also heard about travelers who were quarantined because their seat mate was sick on the flight into China and they may have been exposed.  While still in the air, gave us a health questionnaire to fill out asking if, during the last two weeks, we had been in contact with anyone that fevered, threw up, coughed, had diarrhea, had a runny nose or was otherwise ill.  We both lied and said we had not been near anyone with such symptoms.  Then, just to be sure I was not fevering while walking through the airport, Katrina gave me some Tylenol to take 30 minutes before landing.</editorial>
</p>

<p>
Just as the plane parked at the gate, an announcement was made that quarantine officials were coming on board and that we should remain seated in our seats.  <editorial>I felt like Katrina and I would pass muster, but many of the other travelers on the plane had been hacking up a storm throughout the whole flight.  Would be in the quarantine radius?</editorial>  Even though the announcement to remain seated was made in Chinese and English, none of the Chinese passengers stayed seated!  As far as I could see, no health officials came on board, and we were soon released into the international arrivals terminal.
</p>

<p>
The international terminal is HUGE and very open.  A single span of roof flows unpartitioned from one end of the terminal to the other, held up by widely spaced, white steel columns.  The roof rises slightly in the center of the terminal to give even more height to the building.  The length of the ceiling is accentuated the pinstripe-esque ceiling cover which is built of long parallel lines of boards.
</p>

<p>
We first went through health inspection, where we handed in our health questionnaire to masked officials.  Then we walked through two sets of fever detectors.  <editorial>In addition to the Tylenol, I was wearing a baseball cap as I noticed that head gear appeared cooler than skin onscreen.</editorial>  We then came to customs, where our passports and visas were checked.  
</p>

<p>
We boarded a tram to take us away from the international terminal and to the baggage claim.  The tram rode past a long median of grass, where some workers were busy with brooms and others were relieving themselves in public view!  The tram passed the station to a yet unfinished terminal before finally arriving at the baggage claim area and the end of the track.  We collected our bags at the carousel, and then walked through the unmanned luggage inspection area and into the hall with curb-side arrival and check in counters.
</p>

<p>
There we met Glenn, our Beijing guide.  Glenn ran us over to an HSBC ATM and then ran us out to the curb.  He soon explained that we were running everywhere because the Forbidden City closes at 5pm, and it was almost 3pm already.
</p>

<p>
From the car I observed that the Audi A6 is the limo of choice in Beijing.  Our driver took us onto the highway and soon we made it to the sixth and outermost ring road.  Beijing drivers install extra wide mirrors in their cars so they can see who is creeping into their lane from the side.  Drivers freely weave from one lane to the next, doing do slowly but assertively so that other traffic does not hit them!
</p>

<p>
Because of the dense smog – it is as thick as fog but of light, browner color and not cool at all – we could only see a city block or two in any direction.  We did drive down some avenues of tall business towers that were maybe 30 stories tall.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256743086">
<p>
Finally we made it to the north entrance of the Forbidden City.  Just north of this entrance and across the street is a hill topped with a viewing platform to let you look across the Forbidden City length.  We did not get to see this vista.  Instead we headed past the water moat, which at 50’ or 100’ in width was similar to Tokyo’s imperial moat, and to the first defensive wall of the city.  This wall rises straight up and must be 50’ thick.  Passing through it we came to a second wall, then looking left saw a limestone hill with a temple on top.  Glenn had explained to us in the car that to build the Forbidden City, there was first a 10 year effort to prepare the building materials followed by 3 years of active construction.  The limestone hill we were seeing came from the bottom of a lake and was transported to the Forbidden City.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256743581">
<p>
In this second walled space there were gardens and trees as old as 500 years.  The whole Forbidden City was teaming with tourists.  Most visitors were Chinese, but we did see some foreigners too.  We seemed to be seeing the city in reverse order, as we fought against the flow of the crowds for most of the visit.  There was much more pushing, bumping and staring than what we had experienced in Japan.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256743758">
<p>
Going through a third perimeter wall, we saw the “Couples Tree,” actually pair of trees planted side by side and grown so that they met each other in the middle.  Glenn took our portrait here.  Soon we saw the wedding suite, where the married couple stays for three days after the marriage ceremony.  The suite becomes the empress’s quarters thereafter.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256744070">
<p>
All of the important buildings of the Forbidden City are aligned in a north-south row.  The emperor’s quarters are immediately to the south of the empress’s building.  The throne room is next in the north-south procession, and is followed by the hall of justice.  All of the buildings have yellow tiled roofs – yellow is the imperial color – with red columns and beams.  The largest beams are painted with geometric patterns and dragons.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256745197">
<p>
Some of the central official buildings were built on raised platforms, so you would have to climb five flights of stairs to get to their entrances.  The north-south axis of the Forbidden City is paved with a smooth, stone pathway.  When this path comes to a staircase, it splits the run of stairs in two.  The pathway turned ramp is then ornamented with intricate stone carvings of dragons.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256746154">
<p>
Glenn also showed us the large caldrons for fire fighting, and pointed out the many incense burners in the shapes of cranes or turtles – animals associated with long life.  We also stopped to see a small exhibit of armor, weapons and instruments.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256747757">
<p>
Before exiting through the south gate, we came to a river with five bridges.  The center bridge was to only be used for the emperor, bridges to its sides were for the royal family, and the outer most bridges were from officials.  If you were any lower ranked, you would have to walk to the walls on the far edge of the courtyard and cross the river as there.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256748194">
<p>
Outside of the Forbidden City’s south gate was a park and parade grounds.  Military troops were marching and practicing formations.  We walked east along the Forbidden City’s moat and found our driver waiting for us at the first main street.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256749011">
<p>
The Jinqiao Hotel was maybe two miles east of Beijing’s city center.  We checked in to room (apartment?) B1018 and were awed by the size of the room.  Our Cambridge apartment could not have been larger than this room.  B1018 had a kitchen, a washer, a living room with a computer, a bathroom and a bedroom with twin beds.
</p>

<p>
Katrina and I dressed up a little, and then headed for the taxi stand in front of the hotel.  We have already noticed that service here is not as pleasant or as friendly as it was in Japan, and that tips are again expected.  Glenn and the hotel receptionist had written us a little card with the address (58 Qianmen Dajie) of the Gongdelin vegetarian restaurant we wanted to try.  We showed this card to our taxi driver, and he took us back into the city center on a huge, divided east-west road called Qianmen Street.  We passed the central north-south axis of the city, home to Tian’men Square, the National Museum, and Mao’s mausoleum, and then went a few more long blocks west.  The driver pointed to a restaurant on the far side of the divided road and then said something in Chinese which we took to mean that was the restaurant we wanted.  At the next intersection, the taxi driver did a U-turn but then drove past the restaurant!  At the next major intersection, he turned south and stopped at the mouth of a back alley.  By gestures, he told us to go down the back alley and turn right once we made it to the first street.  Or that is at least what we think he meant!
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, this back alley did not connect to another street for almost 1km!  It was poorly lighted in many places, busy with people eating at small restaurants or eating dinner outside their houses (and in the alley).  We tried stopping in a hotel to ask where the restaurant was, but the receptionist, though helpful, did not know.  Eventually we finished our 1km trek west and turned north to refind the main boulevard.  We followed Qianmen Street east for 1km, retracing the taxi’s route.  Along the way we looked at a restaurant I thought was the one the driver had pointed to, but they were clearly serving meat.  We stopped in two more hotels and asked for directions without luck.  
</p>

<p>
Pretty soon, we had walked all the way back to where the bum taxi driver had dropped us off and left with our 18 yuan fare.  Walking the block had been scary, especially considering all the travel money Katrina and I had on our persons.  In the alley, people had been openly staring at us and they did not drop their gaze when we stared right back.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256759069">
<p>
We checked on a curbside city information map, and saw that there was a south running Qianmen Dajie that ended at Tian’men Square, the tourist center of the city.  Heartened, we walked over to Qianmen Dajie and found a very clean, upscale tourist arcade with street car trams running the length of the street.  We felt certain this pedestrian street was the right one and even noticed a posting indicating that the “Ladies of the Month Vegetarian Restaurant” was nearby.  Walking south we finally found 58 Qianmen Dajie, but instead of finding Gongdelin the building contained Zara!  The young Zara staff seemed to know where the restaurant was, but we could not understand their instructions.  We really need a paper map of the city!  We also tried finding the Ladies Vegetarian Restaurant without any luck.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256760692">
<p>
In the end, we entered a hot pot restaurant with an English menu.  We picked out two types of mushrooms, cabbage, tofu, and vermicelli as our hot pot ingredients.  Everything arrived fresh and uncooked in little side dishes.  We then dipped the food into the boiling water of the hot pot to cook it, transferred it onto our plates and covered it in garlic sauce.  The food was fresh if boring.  It cost us ~150 yuan, or ~$24.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256762942">
<p>
Heartened again by having eaten and by having found a tourist safe sanctuary, we decided to walk north and see Tian’men Square itself.  This was only a one block walk, and we passed a national museum building along the way.  In the center of the square were more monument buildings and a large monolith monument too.  On the north end of the square were the gates with the hanging portrait of Chairman Mao.
</p>

<p>
All of these sights we saw through dense sooty smog, glowing in the street lights.  It only took two hours to make me feel the soot in my lungs.  The whole city of Beijing smells of coal.  My clothes smell of coal.  The cars here are covered in ash and my nose hairs tickle from captured ash.  I was already starting to cough after dinner, just like the locals who hack and spit on to the ground.  <editorial>I guess that the coughing passengers on this morning’s flight probably were not sick at all, just victims of the smog.</editorial>  Nothing here is completely clean for all the soot.  The people here look more weathered than the smooth, shiny people of Tokyo.
</p>

<p>
On the second try, we found a cabbie that knew how to get to our hotel.  It was a 12 yuan ride back to the north/east crook of the second ring road.  We showered, boiled water for brushing our teeth, thanked God we would be leaving Beijing’s atmosphere tomorrow, and then went to sleep in separate beds.
</p>

<p>
Some things I have noticed so far.  There is sooty smog everywhere.  The people here know less English, but there is good English signage.  People are more directed in their staring at us.  People here are noisier, less organized and less efficient than in Japan.  Our money goes further here and taxis are cheap.  The city has many 1 and 2 story buildings with colorful eastern looking facades.
</p>

</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256795369">
<h3><a name="091029">10/29/09</a></h3>
<p>
We got up at 5:15 AM to finish packing and meet Glen by 6:00 AM.  The hotel had packed breakfast of two hard-boiled eggs, milk in a plastic bag, bread, jam, and meat plus a pear.  I ate the bread and an egg in the car to the airport but avoided the pear even though it looked great!  There was no traffic at this time of the morning.  We made it to the highly ornate tollbooths; Glen escorted us to the ticket counters, checked us in, and we parted with Glen at security.  I tipped him 100 yuan (about 15 dollars) but I don’t really know how much was actually expected or appropriate. I also get the feeling that we could have checked ourselves in just fine.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256798350">
<p>
We were in the less-impressive domestic terminal and waited with the noisy crowds heading to Kunming until our Lijiang flight was called.  We both worked on writing our journals and were greatly amused by the health information video of animated pigs avoiding swine flu and keeping healthy.  It was not just about Western style germ prevention but also had some lines about keeping a healthy unstressed mind for best health.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256814152">
<p>
We took off into the morning smog, very dense and already burning in my lungs and within five minutes were over more mountainous areas of little population.  We may have seen a squiggle of the Great Wall over the hills.  The smog persisted for a while, 3 hours of our 3.5 flight to Kunming.
</p>

<p>
For breakfast we had what appeared to be a traditional meal: white porridge, pickled veggies and eggs, maple yogurt and a meat sandwich.  Before landing, the crew led us all in an in-seat exercise routine; everyone participated.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256814593">
<p>
For the forty minutes before Kunming, we could see the dry, rugged, knife-edge mountains northeast of the city.  There were trees on some of the slopes, and there were many farms and terraces too.  The smog had cleared significantly, but it thickened a bit as Kunming came into sight.  It was “bad day in California” thick.  Kunming looks huge, with many tall apartment blocks in triplicate or more.  We had a very short layover with enough time to buy cucumber Lays potato chips; Kat really liked them, and I thought they were okay.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256819632">
<p>
The second flight was quick, maybe 1 hour long.  From the plane, we could see Jade Snow Mountain and the mountains that form Tiger Leaping Gorge.  We landed in a valley east of Lijiang, which itself is east of the mountain and south of the gorge.  
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256824097">
<p>
Outside baggage claim, we met Alvin, our guide for this area.  He took us to our driver, who honked his way away from the airport.  The driver would honk when passing anyone, so the others would know where he was.  He also honked at pedestrians crossing the street (traffic does not slow for them) and honked at ambling bicycles that shared the road.  Alvin told us that Lijiang has about 200,000 people, is at about 8,000 feet, and has no major industries besides farming and tourism.  For this reason, Lijiang has very little air pollution.  He also told us that 52 minorities of China live in Yunnan; 24 minorities are here in Lijiang.
</p>

<p>
The driver took us around the old town outskirts, going along the east, south and then western sides.  New Lijiang looked lively and fun itself.  When we stopped, I tried to tip the driver, but he would not take it.  I still have not figured out tipping here.  Alvin tells me not to tip at restaurants.  
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256825747">
<p>
Walking into the Old town, we found it to be absolutely beautiful.  The walkways are cobblestone, but made from an interesting conglomerate stone that looks a bit like modern polished concrete.  The stores and hotels are two or three stories high, have open storefronts on the street, are built of wood with tiled roofs, and are brightly painted and have intricate wood carvings too.  The streets are also full of flowers, some from the recent October 1 celebration <editorial> for 60 years of modern China</editorial>.
</p>

<p>
Our hotel is the Sanhe Hotel, which purports to be styled in the Naxi minority style.  Stan booked us in a standard double deluxe room, which is very comfortable, with wood furnishing that remind Kat of Switzerland, and a marble bathroom.  The sad surprise is that – yet again – we have separate beds.  The staff helped us push the beds together to make a King.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256827045">
<p>
Alvin then took us to a late lunch at Mishi.  We had warned him in the car that we are vegetarian, and so we were greeted with tofu and green soup, snow-peas, broccoli, mushrooms and bamboo.  There was enough food for four people!  All of the veggie dishes had a clear garlic sauce and let us taste the vegetables.  We were very happy to get some greens in us.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256829733">
<p>
Alvin departed after lunch, and we began to wander the old town.  We followed one long street to the very southernmost tip.  Along the way we passed restaurants, hotels, yak product stores, convenience stores, leather shops, local clothing and weaving shops, silver shops, wood-carving, calligraphy, travel guide/agents, sweet shops, and jewelry stores.  These same types of shop would show up over and over again, sometimes with very similar (the same?) products.  At first every building was a tourist business, but as we went south, services for the locals began to appear.  In the northern sections, the paths run along canals, which are lined with flowers and footbridges.  It is very pretty and even has Venice beat.  In the southern parts, the tourist glitz disappears, more construction projects are visible, as the locals create more “old town.”
</p>

</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256833954">
<p>
On our way south, I saw cushion covers that I really liked, and Kat and I stopped to look.  In other stores, they were marked as 15 yuan each, but this shopkeeper told us it was 30 yuan each.  We threatened to walk and in the end bought 3 covers for 70 yuan.  I am pretty sure that these are the exact covers that are 15 yuan elsewhere, but oh well, we’ll have to try much harder next time.
</p>

<p>
Alvin says that Lijiang received historical status in 1997 after a huge earthquake shook this region.  The old city largely withstood the earthquake, as the wood construction is flexible.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256834922">
<p>
Once we reached the end of the old town, we turned north again.  It was about 4:30 PM, and we saw locals bringing children home from school. Some were on bikes or scooters; most walked together.  In the old town, no cars are allowed, but some service vehicles drive about.  I’ve noticed that half of these vehicles are electric.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256836840">
<p>
We walked back past Mu’s residence, the local palace equivalent, and then headed west and up a hill.  At the top we found an over-look park with views of the city and the surrounding mountains, Jade Snow mountain included.  The park is crowned with a modern five story pagoda, and it was from this vantage point that we watched the sunset.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256841983">
<p>
Walking back to the hotel, we tried a bit of cake from a street vendor.  It was rice-flour based and unexciting.  After using the bathroom in the hotel, we ventured out again looking for dinner.  The city was now lit with lanterns and accent lighting and was very beautiful, especially along the canals.  The crowds are thicker at night than in the day.  We ate at Green Papaya “Italian” restaurant but ate off the local menu.  We had uninspiring Naxi wheat cake (a fried pancake) and not-fantastic eggplant.  To make it all obnoxious, an amplified, untalented musician was bombarding the street with folk/pop songs.  At least dinner was cheap, 25 yuan.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256850770">
<p>
On the way back to the hotel, Kat bought a drinkable yak yogurt from the market.  It was actually good; tastes honey and could pass as cow yogurt.
</p>

<p>
We are now ready for bed but will unfortunately have to endure the pounding bass from the bar district.  The pounding is not loud here but is clearly audible and not ignorable.  Stan should be told that this hotel’s location is too close to the bar route.
</p>

</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256890404">
<h3><a name="091030">10/30/09</a></h3>

<p>
Regardless of the bumping bar beats, we fell asleep very quickly last night.  Among other things, I dreamt I was eating a white larva.  I bit into it, and even though it did not taste bad, I couldn’t finish eating a thing with so many legs, so I spit it back out.  
</p>

<p>
For real breakfast, we crossed the road to the Lamu Tibetan house that has a deal with our hotel.  They fed us toast, fried eggs, oatmeal and tea.  Here Katrina and I used email.  
</p>
</span>
<p>
<span class="timestamp" id="1256893030" style="display:inline;">
Alvin met us at 9:00 AM, and we started walking to the Jade Black Dragon Pool park.  It was still very cool out, maybe high 40s, so we had on sweaters and shells.
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256894312" style="display:inline;">
This park belonged to the local ruler Mu family.  From the lake, you can see Jade Dragon Snow Mountain reflecting in the water and also see Kneeling Elephant Hill on the side.  There is a bridge and a pagoda on the water that makes the vista extra-special.  The park’s pool is fed by a spring, and the locals were here with jugs for collecting the water and taking it home.
</span>  
</p>
<span class="timestamp" id="1256895107">
<p>
In the park, I touched a good luck “mahjong tree!”  In the park was also a temple to the snow mountain deity, represented in human form as a warrior on a horse.  Here we saw an artist doing “palm paintings,” where he used his hands as the brush and painted mountains and waterfalls.  Alvin told us about how the moon pagoda on the lake burned down in the 1940s when two Naxi lovers that were forbidden to marry committed suicide.  We would later learn in the Naxi cultural museum that love suicide was not uncommon since there were arranged marriages and suicide lovers would be together in the afterlife.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256897989">
<p>
We also learned that the marriage proposal is done by the boy giving the girl an embroidery needle.  If the girl then returns an embroidered piece of work to the boy, that means she has accepted.  
</p>

<p>
In one of the lakeside buildings, we got to see an example of the embroidery.  Three women were working on pieces, and lots of finished works were hung to see.  There were birds, flowers, cranes, tigers, and mountain landscapes, but the most memorable piece to me was a Mona Lisa reproduction.  The artists were able to create shading with their thread, by a kind of cross-hatching using multiple threads of similar tones.  The end result is very realistic when you stand back a few feet.  The costs of the larger pieces were in the 1000s of yuan.  Some pieces take many days to make or even many months.
</p>

<p>
Although this was a shopping opportunity, neither Alvin nor the shopkeeper was pushy in any way about our buying.  They just let us look around and leave when we wanted to.  This non-pushiness is typical for Lijiang, and I appreciate it.
</p>

<p>
We continued on, and Alvin told us about the “walking marriages” of the people living near Lake Lugo.  He says that if you are interested in someone, you tickle their palm during the community dance; if they tickle you back, you are set.  In this matrilineal society, there are no marriages.  Rather, men go to the homes of their girlfriends in the night and make sure to leave by daybreak.  Men and women may change lovers freely and children only have moms, not dads.  Uncles to children also play important roles in up-bringing.  
</p>

<p>
Alvin dropped us off at the Naxi cultural museum, and the guide there showed us Naxi costumes, told us about Naxi elders (only 30 are left for 300,000 Naxi), and about their still-used pictogram alphabet and about marriage ceremonies.  
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256900177">
<p>
Alvin then walked us along New Town to old town (and passed a mother holding her son over some newspaper on the sidewalk so that he could poop!) and then took us a back way to Mu’s place.  Mu’s Place is mostly a reconstruction, but the original rivaled the Forbidden City.  Mu’s also has its important buildings in a row.  First is the meeting and the war hall, then the hall of learning/reading, then the hall of justice, then finally the hall of entertainment.  Up on the hill was a functioning Taoist temple.  The residences were to the side of the main axis and were rather modest.  Like the rest of Lijiang, the grounds were very flowery and incorporated running water canals.  The Mu family occupied the place from Kubla Khan up until the last Emperor and was opportunistic about their alliances.  They realized that they could not fight strong invaders; so they welcomed them instead.  The Mu family is a Naxi line.
</p>

<p>
Alvin said that a poor income in Lijiang is about 500 yuan per month.  A medium income is 2,000 to 4,000 yuan.  The rich income I don’t remember but was closer to 10,000 a month.  Only rich families have cars.  Some families with homes in the old city can rent their homes and have all the income they need for living in the new city.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256908166">
<p>
Alvin then took us by mini-bus into the new city for dumplings.  The bus was a small van and cost 1 yuan per person.  The dumpling shop was only four minutes away and was a modern place with glass walls.  It had the typical high tables so appreciated after Japan.  Alvin ordered 20 dumplings of each vegetarian type: noodle and cabbage, summer squash, and leek.  We also ordered pumpkin cakes with sweet cheese sauce.  I liked everything very much, but 20 dumplings a piece is way too much!  Then Alvin went and ordered another 20!  We told Alvin our Egyptian feast story and accused him of over-feeding us.  In the end, we took a doggie bag with 18 dumplings home.  (One hour later, Katrina and I both had tummy aches.)
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256910852">
<p>
Next we walked around the vegetable market.  There were animal products and live animals too, fish (all live), eels, frogs, turtles, chickens which we avoided seeing, Chinese medicine stands (with dried lizards), brassware and clothes.  It was quite a large market.  In general the veggies and fruit looked good, but I am too suspicious of Chinese sanitation to sample anything.  I would like to try a peel-covered fruit, but how can I peel it without touching the insides too?
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256911826">
<p>
Finally Alvin walked us here and there back to the hotel.  We stopped to buy postcards but were turned off by the price.  Alvin took us to the supermarket and helped us pick out red wine from the Kunming area.  We tried it later and were not so impressed!  
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256921853">
<p>
It was only 3 PM, but our belly aches had hit, so we rested in bed until 4:30 PM.  Then we headed to the theater in new town for our Minority Culture Dance Extravaganza.  We had fourth row seats (the row was too short for my knees).  Like many things Chinese, the volume was turned up too loud.  The opening act was a Chinese orchestra, and one of the back row musicians was staring at me during the whole piece!  Accepted crowd behavior is different, because people were talking, taking video and even flash photography, and arriving late to the show.  
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256924381">
<p>
The rest of the acts were dance pieces with recorded music and song played over the speakers.  Lots of fog machine and spot lighting effects were used.  Most were fun but some could induce seizures!  The dances were a mix of modern dance with native costume, plus with native story and ritual mixed in.  The ever-present silk sheets as waves were used, and there was some flying rope/sheet action too, just like in Hawaii.  
</p>

<p>
Overall it was fun, funny and enjoyable, mainly because it was so over the top.  Kat thinks that the dancers were from the representative minorities; I’m skeptical, and I think many were Han.
</p>

<p>
After the show, we came home to prepare for tomorrow’s hike and go to sleep.

<p>
We got up at 5:30am to meet Alvin at 6am.  It was still dark as we drove out of Lijiang and over the mountains towards Shangri La.  The first lightening of the sky happened around 7am, after we had traveled up the first line of mountains, down the tree lined highway and were about to descend into Shangri La.  Viewing the mountains as early morning silhouettes made the mountains’ heft and mass visible and at the same time hide the man-made scars of farms, quarries and factories.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256973229">
<p>
The sun was up enough to see all those other details by the time the highway had descended to the valley floor and was tracking along the Yangtze River.  Lots of farms of corn or tobacco are built in terraces on the valley walls.  The valley was already filling with disappointing smoke from cooking fires and the handful of factories.  Shangri La itself was a medium sized town that did not look interesting at all from the road.  It is on the west bank of the Yangtze.  The forks in Shangri La – well, perhaps it is met by a tributary here – and at this junction is a massive amount of deposited gravel.  Trucks were working to extract the gravel.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256975943">
<p>
Our driver took us up the ever narrowing gorge to a viewpoint.  We were across the river from Jade Snow Mountain, on the slope of his “brother” mountain Haba.  Haba Snow Mountain is almost the same size as Jade Snow Mountain.  Alvin told us that the Yangtze was a beautiful girl, trying to find her mother at the sea.  The two brother mountains tried to stop her in her journey to the sea because they wanted her to stay with them.  She danced from them for seven nights until the brothers fell asleep and then she slipped off to the sea.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256976114">
<p>
It was still only 8am by this point, and we decided to walk down the tourist path to the river rapids below.  In 1986, ten Chinese rafters tried to navigate the Tiger Leaping Gorge and three of the party died in the attempt.  When we got out of the van, it was very cold outside and I was worried that we had not packed enough clothes.  I had brought zip-off pants, wool socks, a t-shirt, a thermal shirt, a long sleeve shirt, a rain shell and a winter hat.  Katrina also looked cold.
</p>

<p>
We went to use the bathrooms and found Chinese trough toilets with no doors and only cubicle height partitions for privacy.  This was fine for me for peeing, but Katrina could not handle the lack of amenity for her needs.  We shivered our way down 10 minutes worth of steps to the water.  The Yangtze is very brown, and in this constricted passage it was roiled in to one large flow of white water.  The rapid is huge, but does not last long until the next path of calm water.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256977378">
<p>
We started climbing back up the steps and then Katrina had a break-down.  I think she was worried about the cold weather and the poor toilet facilities, angry for having demanded that we leave at 6am and as a result we had missed 1 hour worth of mountain scenery in the dark, and concerned that just these 10 minutes of stairs were so difficult and we had yet to start our long hike!  Kat did recover herself and we boarded the van to continue on.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256979167">
<p>
The van dropped us off just 10 minutes up stream from the river stairs.  I was wearing my backpacking pack with the extra clothing and water, Katrina had her small daypack.  Alvin also had packed in just a day pack.  
</p>

<p>
We hiked along the road at first, climbing to a small village with a school where children waved to us from the third floor window and said “hi!”  Within 30 minutes all our fears of being too cold had subsided, and we were peeling off layers to get down to our t-shirts.  
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256979808">
<p>
We passed farms with corn and pumpkins.  The corn is being dried and then husked for feed.  We also passed a few fellows offering horse rides to hikers making the initial climb.  The road narrowed down to a one-person track, and the climb got harder as we neared the 2 hour point and the Naxi Guesthouse.  Along the track were good views of Jade Snow Mountain and its multiple peaks.  The mountain rises almost 5,000 meters, while the river is at 1,500 meters elevation.  The upstream peaks are the ones covered with snow, though on this side of the mountain there is no glacier.  From here, you can only see the edge of the Lijiang facing glacier running along the tip of one peak.  The peaks are sharp and jagged like saw teeth, and the view from river to mountain top is so vertically large that it was hard to comprehend and even made me slightly disoriented.  I had a similar feeling of being out of my element in Muren, Switzerland, but I think the elevation difference was more extreme there in the Alps.  The Tiger Leaping Gorge trail is very dusty, and our boots were completely dirty by 11am when we reached the Naxi Guesthouse.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256984683">
<p>
At Naxi GH, we had a lunch of broccoli, snow peas, fried noodles with vegetables, and pumpkin soup.  All the dishes were very good and not so spice in white sauces.  Alvin says the locals make non-spicy dishes for foreign guests.  We ate in the nice inner courtyard of the guesthouse at a very low table.  Katrina used the free internet connection and I got some bottled water and cookies for our hike.  Each of our lunch plates cost about 7 yuan, and Alvin threatened to be “an Egyptian” and force us to order more food.  I get the feeling he has a much larger lunch budget for us than is needed for vegetarians.  To appease Alvin we got a strawberry syrup pancake to eat later on the path.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256988905">
<p>
We were only the forth people down the path that morning when we left from the Naxi Guesthouse.  The climb got much more serious as we approached the 28 Bends.  We kept hitting switchbacks and asking Alvin if this was the 1st bend of the 28.  No, no, and no.  We passed a concession stand and then the countable bends started.  We counted them in Chinese together, taking frequent breaks and drinking lots of water.  The face we were climbing looked to be 70 degrees steep and climbed the face of Haba Mountain very quickly.  Somehow we managed to count 30 bends on the climb!  Oh well.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256992699">
<p>
The climb peaked at 2,600 meters of elevation.  Here was another small concession stand.  The sales woman wanted 8 yuan to let us take photos from a razor spit above the gorge!  On principle we refused, and just took pictures from the path instead.  The view was still quite good and let you look from river to peak.  At this point in the hike, the 5 or more peaks of the “dragon’s back” were all lined up in a row and all individually visible.
</p>

<p>
The next section of trail was a descent across a very steep slope.  Alvin slipped a few times but remained on his feet and, more importantly, on the trail!  There was forest and some bamboo on our mountain side.  We could see the other hiking party ahead of us.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256995810">
<p>
When the descent slowed and the forest dropped away, we came to a great view point looking south up the river.  We could see the steps down to the rapids that we had hiked in the morning.  By now, the area was full of busses.  The annoying smoke from the morning had mostly blown clear out of the gorge too.  The view point was fantastic, and you could feel the steepness of both sides of the river.  We ate our strawberry cake here as we enjoyed the view.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256996749">
<p>
The following 1.5 hours to Tea-Horse Guesthouse stayed mostly level as it crossed the mountainside.  Jade Snow Mountain was on our right as we hiked.  The mountain’s angles shifted slowly as we moved, and the dragon’s back line of peaks started scrunching together.  The path here was precipitously steep off the sides.  If any of us had a fear of heights we would have known it then.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256998580">
<p>
Tea-Horse GH was in a village with drivable access to the low river road of our morning stair climb.  At Tea-Horse, we restocked our water supplies.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256999454">
<p>
The forests of the morning faded away and the vistas began opening up to the north.  It appears that the gorge is narrower to the north, even though the tallest Jade Mountain peaks are in the south.  On our side of Haba Mountain the slope was getting even steeper, the foliages drier and more ferns and scrub brush was present.  
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257002355">
<p>
We passed an overhang that looked like a man’s profile about 1.5 hours before the hike ended.  In the valley below, Alvin pointed out a factory that extracts wostun (?) from the mountain.  From time to time we would see goat herds and herders.  Terraced farms could also be seen down below.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257004773">
<p>
Finally, around 4 pm we saw the village of the Halfway House.  This village too is serviced by the low river road, and there is a fantastic section of switch backs that climb to it.  The guesthouse has three stories of rooms, most with mountain views and all occupied!  We go stuck in a ground-floor room with less of a view, but the room does have a private bathroom with a western toilet and shower.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257007186">
<p>
We had a dinner of fried mixed veggies including cauliflower and tomatoes, egg noodles and chocolate pancake.  We ate up on the rooftop “inspiration” deck with French, Israeli, British, Scottish and Irish travelers for company.  Most were on longer trips than us – one girl was wrapping up one year of travels!
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257010773">
<p>
The sunset cast nice color on the Jade Snow Mountain and then a nearly full moon rose above the peaks.  So pretty!  Katrina and I talked to an Irish guy and a British girl about their travels and experiences in China.  We retired around 8pm to write.
</p>

<p>
Oh, it seems that Katrina lost 500 photos taken from when we were in Takayama up until today!  I hope we can recover them from the memory card!
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257059850">
<h3><a name="091101">11/1/09</a></h3>

<p>
We got up in time for a 7 AM breakfast.  I had yogurt with apples and bananas, and Kat had a pancake.  Alvin met us and told us that Sean, one of the other guesthouse owners, had been killed last week on one of the bridges crossing the Yangtze River.  He did not clarify if Sean was killed in an automobile accident.  Alvin then explained that the two dogs at the Halfway Guesthouse had been Sean’s.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257061591">
<p>
When we started hiking at 7:45 AM, one of the puppies followed us.  I don’t know what the puppy wanted – to go home to Sean’s guesthouse or just to be with us westerners – but it hiked with us for 15 minutes before reaching a farmhouse full of dogs on the trail and not wanting to pass the barking beasts.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257062043">
<p>
Today’s portion of the trail was mostly level for the first hour of hiking.  However, the trail was on a steeper slope (cliff) then before and was cut into the rock hillside.  I felt more precarious today.  The trail was also crossed by a waterfall at one point, and that would have been very frightening in the wet season.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257064218">
<p>
Our hike had great sunrise color and gave us new views to the opening of the gorge to the north and the mountain valley beyond.  
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257064982">
<p>
The second hour of hiking was a descent back to the river road to Tina’s guesthouse.  This took us through treeless grazing pastures.  The continuous descent caused my left knee some dull discomfort in the illiotibial band.  
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257068429">
<p>
At Tina’s guesthouse, we got a ride from the owner of the Halfway guesthouse.  The owner had been a tour leader himself before opening his guesthouse business.  He was driving a Great Wall SUV and ripping along the gorge at speeds that made me long for a seat-belt.  Every so often, we would ask him to stop so that we could take pictures up or down the gorge.  Alvin hopped out and took pictures too; I think he must have gotten some personal enjoyment from our hike.  As we got towards the north end of the gorge, the road was more and more beat up by rock-slide damage.  We saw both divots in the road from fallen rocks and also fallen-away sections of pavement.  Road crews were working (on Sunday!) to repair the damage.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257070446">
<p>
The north of the gorge opens into a high mountain valley, split by a continuing Yangtze river gorge of lower walls.  On our side of the river was “new town,” a collection of brick buildings that surface quite a large expanse of plateau farming land.  Frankie, the SUV driver, took us on a dirt road through this farmland because that was the way to the river ferry.  
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257071519">
<p>
Frankie stopped before the road started its descent to the river and let us out.  For a few minutes, Frankie and Alvin tried calling the ferry boatman on cell phone because they were worried we had arrived earlier than expected, and the boatman may not be at his boat.  No one answered the phone calls, but we decided to hike down anyways and see what we could find.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257072232">
<p>
Frankie pointed us to a shortcut path that was quicker than following the dirt road.  We were descending from the farming plateau – almost desert-like with brown scrub foliage – down the 500 foot cliff to the water.  We followed the hiking trail halfway down the cliff, but then Alvin lost track of the trail.  This was the second time in our two day hike that he had taken a wrong turn.  We could see the ferries below, but the cliff had steepened to almost-vertical, and we could not find an obvious path.  Kat forced the decision to hike back up to the dirt road and then to follow that down.  The only problem was that the dirt road appeared to head much too far downstream, and Katrina was not convinced that we were on the correct fork of the road.  So Kat stayed up on top (not wanting to back-track up the hill if the path turned out to be wrong) while Alvin and I descended. 80% of the way down, it finally became clear that the road serviced the ferry, so I waved my hat over my head (a pre-arranged signal) to tell Kat to come down.  She did, and we finished the final 20% together, finding fresh horse poop on the trail as an encouraging sign that we were on the right path.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257074255">
<p>
Both ferry boats were on the far side of the river when we approached.  Alvin hollered across the river to get their attention, and after a painful few minutes pause, the men started heading towards the boat.  The Yangtze at the crossing point was no wider than the Connecticut River in Hanover, but it runs swiftly. (Actually, never on the hike did I see rapids that looked too large to raft, but then again, I was 3000 ft up in the air.)  The ferry was pointed upstream during its crossing and was running almost at full throttle.  It hid in an eddy on our side so that we could board and then took us across in three minutes.  I was trying to figure out how the boat got to this point on the river, as there are cliffs on both sides and rapids both up and down river.  I bet they built the boat at the river’s edge.  
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257075397">
<p>
We hiked up the cliff on the far side and onto the east plateau.  This too was all sectioned off for farming.  We walked for 10 minutes past men and women tending the land, plowing with oxen and picking greens, hauling corn stalks in hand-pulled wagons into town.  It was actually very picturesque and cool to see.  In the dirt road village, we went to the Da Ju Inn.  Its inner courtyard was shaded by a big persimmon tree.  Five kids were watching cartoons, and an old man was watching us.  The innkeeper was there, as were his wife and daughter.  
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257077369">
<p>
Alvin ordered veggie food for us – cabbage soup, fried cabbage, eggplant, ma po tofu in pepper sauce and a bucket of rice.  While we waited, we tried the persimmons off the tree and enjoyed yet another day of warm sunshine.  The food came and was terrific; everything was local grown or made, including the tofu.  Kat liked the tofu the best; I liked the cabbage stir-fry.  Eventually our driver arrived (he called lost earlier) and ate lunch with Alvin. Alvin told us that this was typical Naxi food and that most of the people we’d met today were Naxi.  Alvin is one-half Naxi himself.
</p>

<p>
Seeing this little farming village, with its beautiful fields, local mud-brick houses and barns, store-houses full of corn, inner courtyards drying corn and other seed, was so amazing.  We were tourists in an un-touristy place.  It was idyllic to walk through, even though those who live here were clearly working hard.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257081717">
<p>
The driver took us out of the farming village, through more fields of greens and corn and back to the “big” local town with paved streets.  We took the freshly paved road out of town and up 28 kilometers of fabulous mountain hill-climb twisties.  For the first half, we were passing terraced hillside farms of corn.  Then there was a checkpoint to make sure that we were not sneaking out any seed for private sale.  The farms gave way to spruce pine forest, some of them showing a few trees in fall yellow.
</p>

<p>
The driver was hitting apexes left and right and using all the road like a racetrack.  I was given confidence by his driving style (even if passengers in this van had no seatbelts).  After cresting the mountain, we headed down an equally long stretch of crappy cobblestone pavement.  As before, there were long views into the distant hazy mountain valleys.  The farms were replaced with grazing cattle, horses, goats, pigs, and soon oxen too.  
</p>

<p>
Eventually, we approached some glacial water pools of brilliant aqua color.  We asked to stop, but Alvin said that the driver was not permitted there, and we would have to take a bus back.  
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257088810">
<p>
We stopped 5 minutes later, at the main center for the Snow Mountain AAAAA National Park.  Here were more than 100 tour buses, a huge theater and visitor center, and lots of green shuttle buses to take you to the park attractions.  The place was also mobbed with Chinese tourists.  We took the bus to the Spruce Meadow cable car and then went up to the meadow itself.  The meadow is surrounded by forest (open forest with leeches!) and no one knows why the trees don’t grow in the meadow too.  From the meadow you could have good views of the Snow Mountain, if it was not hidden by clouds as it was on-and-off for us.  Also in the meadow were yaks and horses.  Chinese tourists were taking group photos next to the yaks.
</p>

<p>
The meadow was a place where Naxi lovers would commit suicide by poison, hanging or jumping off a cliff in order to be with their lover in The Third Kingdom.  
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257091893">
<p>
We went back down on the gondola to the blue pools.  However, it became clear that the pools were man-made blockages of a glacial river, which made them less interesting.  The best thing here was watching paying tourists ride on a yak into the river and then have their photos taken with the mountain as a backdrop.  
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257093746">
<p>
The clouds did move around enough to let us see the glacier on the mountain.  It looks like the glacier is only 25% of its full size; perhaps it will start snowing again soon and replenish it.  On the bus ride back to our car, there were great sunbeams breaking through the clouds.  
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257095679">
<p>
It was only 30 minutes drive back to Lijiang, and most of the time was spent driving across a high desert plain.  Alvin told us that this plain was where World War II American pilots crash-landed after flying over the Himalayas from India.  
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257100774">
<p>
Back in Lijiang, we cleaned up and got pizza and ravioli for dinner.  We then came back to the room and wrote out 16 postcards to family. 
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257148330">
<h3><a name="091102">11/2/09</a></h3>

<p>
We got up at 6:30am so we could pack our bags and get breakfast of toast, fried eggs, porridge, and tea at the Lamu House.  Katrina and I tag-teamed email writing so one of us could eat while the other wrote.  The restaurant was also full of French tourists.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257152808">
<p>
Alvin met us as the front desk at 8am, and together we found our driver.  We headed south, past the Lijiang Airport and to Dali.  The road went through huge swaths of farm land valley, which was nowhere as picturesque as yesterday’s farmland but still super-productive.  Corn stalks were being taken down and broad beans, garlic, peas and (maybe) wheat were being planted.  In the Dali area we also say peas growing on the old tobacco plant stalks.
</p>

<p>
Over the 180km of driving, we went from valley to mountains/hills to valley and back to mountain.  We probably did this three times.  The first mountains where planted in terraces, the later ones where not planted at all and hand scrubby, rocky land.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257158047">
<p>
It was raining off and on during the trip.  We say lots of farmers walking along the road with farm tools in one hand and umbrella in the other.  Alvin explained to me that the farmers are granted access to certain lots of land for 15 year periods without any rent.  The food they grow can be consumed, sold at market or sold to the government.  Some farmers also sublet their plots to others.
</p>

<p>
Alvin also explained that the seed checkpoint we saw yesterday was a local community organized checkpoint to ensure that only local seed varieties were being used.
</p>

<p>
Also along the road we passed several towns, some with factories producing brick and cinderblock, other with big stone-cutting saws.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257159492">
<p>
Near Dali at Shaping, we met the Dali guide Michael.  Alvin said goodbye; we thanked him and tipped him 300 yuan (was that appropriate?) and then he presumably took a bus back to Lijiang.  Our driver stayed on through the day.  (He has a radar detector which he calls an “electronic dog.”  The detector is on the dash, hidden under a plastic bag.)
</p>

<p>
Right were Alvin departed was the Shaping Monday market.  In the rain, we rushed through the market in 10 minutes flat.  Michael pointed out the marijuana seeds for sale, “the locals never smoke weed”, and we also say veggies, potatoes, fish, clothing, trinkets, cloth, and prepared food for sale.  We purchased a fluffy dough (like pizza dough) filled with caramelized sugar.  It was good.
</p>

<p>
We got back into the car and tracked mud onto the carpets :-(.  Michael told us about the local people, the Bai or the “white people”, who have lived here for a long time.  They really like white and they paint there houses in the color with black art work under the eaves.  Michael says it is their culture to put all of their wealth into their houses.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257160995">
<p>
We drove to a neighborhood of high Bai concentration.  Along the way, we passed a house with a marijuana plant growing visibly out front – apparently the cops don’t care!  In the village we went a tie-dye shop.  There artists here start with white cloth, sketch in a pattern, tie knots into the fabric for the pieces they want to remain white, sew the knots in place, then dye the cloth in big vats of indigo.  The resulting patterns are impressive, geometric and pretty.  If the pieces were not so large, Kat might have plunked down the 240 yuan for an example.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257161906">
<p>
Next we went to a nearby Bai restaurant for lunch.  Michael told the wait staff that we are vegetarians, but they still lead with a fish dish that he sent back.  We had plates of cabbage which tasted like mushu filling, squash, mushrooms, rice, fried local cheese and also bitter cabbage soup and a veggie hot pot.  Katrina and I have both decided that veggie hot pots are boring.  It was too much food but was good.  We sent away a bottle of Dali beer too, because we don’t like beer!
</p>

<p>
Also outside of this restaurant was the wafting smell of weed.  I bet a local was smoking!
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257168504">
<p>
We went to old town Dali and Michael checked use into the huge, resort-like (without the fun) Landscape Hotel.  We got a queen bed room but it was a smoking room.  Since we had been a pain at lunch, we did not ask to change room until later in the day after Michael had left.  Kat and I washed off the Shaping mud from our boots in the tub, and then rejoined Michael for a quick tour of Dali.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257172360">
<p>
Basically, there is one North/South pedestrian street in Dali, with several East/West spurs.  The town is a grid system and is easy to navigate.  Michael showed us the two eateries for dinner, then left us to explore on our own.  We when back to the hotel, got our postcards and then posted them at the post office.
</p>

<p>
We then walked south on the pedestrian walk, checking out the near identical selection of tourist shops to Lijiang.  There are more silver stores here than in Lijiang, a new type of restaurant that displays its ingredients – raw meat, fish and vegetables – outside on the sidewalk, and new tie-dye vendors.  Lijiang had more wood-carving shops than Dali, and Lijiang also has the street canals and yak meat.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257173037">
<p>
The tie-dyes on the streets are also identical to the ones we saw earlier today but they only cost 30 yuan.  The first place was a rip-off!  Did Michael take us there first so that we would not be able to compare prices?
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257173517">
<p>
We checked memory card prices and were quoted 260 yuan for an 8GB SD card.  This compares to 170-360 yuan in Lijiang.  We counter offered 160 yuan and to our surprise, the vender relented.  Bargaining is so weird!
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257173869">
<p>
We continued south and by the middle gate, I saw a male youth running like hell with a purse in his hands!  He must have just stolen it, and seemed to have an accomplice, who was running with him.  This scene completely changed how I looked at the people around me and made me a lot less comfortable with the stares we get from the Chinese.  We both were wary of youths, and were much less excited to keep exploring.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257174113">
<p>
We did venture on top of the South Gate, and from above we watched people pay to sit in a sheep-pulled cart.  We walked down some new streets and were surprised by the huge amount of new building and empty new store fronts just west of the pedestrian mall.  I really doubt that much of “old Dali” is really that old.
</p>

<p>
Dali and Lijiang are rivals in tourism, but I cannot see why people bother with Dali.  The walking city just cannot compare, and there do not seem to be many sites to visit.  Hopefully tomorrow’s tour with make things clear.
</p>

After relaxing in our room, we went to dinner at a slow but cheap Tibetan restaurant.  The food – egg rolls, curry rice and potato hash browns – was fine and the internet was free.  Only Americans were eating there.
</p>

<p>
Now we are back in our hotel.  The bar music of yester-night is gone, but the Chinese guests can be so loud!  Why do they yell to each other so much???!!!
</p>

<h3><a name="091103">11/3/09</a></h3>

<p>
This morning we ate in the hotel's “so-so” breakfast cafeteria (this is how our guide Michael described the place).  There were lots of non-breakfast items in the buffet, which is more typical of a Chinese breakfast.  I ended up with a number of cakes, rolls fried eggs, and (living dangerously) watermelon.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257241691">
<p>
Michael met us after breakfast at 9:30am.  We went by car to the port, crossing the highway to Lijiang and then crossing a section of farmland between the highway and the water.  Again, lots of leafy vegetables were being grown in the fields.  Unlike last, there was no rain this morning and through the haze (smog?) in the air we could see the shapes of mountains on both sides of Lake Erhai.
</p>

<p>
At the ferry port we boarded a smaller vessel – maybe 30’ long - that seemed to be powered by the same modular engine used in the local three-wheeled tractors.  We stood at the bow, checking out the green murky waters, fisherman paddling metal canoes, the distant mountains, and the still being constructed pagodas on the lake side.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257244040">
<p>
We crossed the width of the lake in 30 minutes and docked at a peanut-shaped island (what was its name, Jinsuo Dao?).  Most of the buildings were spread along the shore from the port, and there was evidence that they are digging into the hillside and putting the fill into the lake to make more level land along the shore.  Some of the shore building were two stories tall but had completely empty second floors.  <editorial>Could this be an example of the Bai putting all their money into their homes?</editorial>
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257244245">
<p>
Along the shore walk fishing nets where stacked in heaps.  Some fishermen were using a sewing machine to mend the nets.  Restaurants presented baskets of fish, veggies and fungi out front and offered the customer a chance to create one’s own meal by selecting the raw ingredients.  The more unusual ingredients were eels, snails, mussels, and fake, bean-made jellyfish.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257244475">
<p>
Michael walked us through the town for 30 minutes, showing a few back alleys, a chopped down marijuana plant, the primary school. Michael says Chinese children learn English starting in Kindergarten, and the school kids often blurt out “Hi!” to us when we pass.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257244724">
<p>
Also on this island I saw a fake antique chess set that I thought I could give to Sam as a gift.  When I asked, the vender said the cost was 280 yuan!  I counter offered 100 yuan (~$15) and stuck with my price until he edged down to 150 yuan.  At this point, I went up to 120 yuan and the deal was done.  Michael watched this whole process from afar without offering any advice.  I spend the rest of the day feeling dumb for paying $20 for a chess set that I would have only paid $5 for in the USA!  Stupid bargaining…
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257245166">
<p>
Michael showed us several Buddhist temples.  He tried to explain to us that there are two types of Buddhism, one type were only Buddha existed and one where anyone can become a Buddha; the latter type of Buddhism in more popular.  
</p>

<p>
There was an old lady at the first temple who was trying to sell incense to us so we could burn in and make a prayer.  When we did not purchase her goods, she stormily followed us to the second temple where she bumped Katrina hard in the arm and tried again to sell us the incense.  We did not buy.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257245497">
<p>
In the town square were also shish kabobs of fish and small birds.  Some nets laid out along the shore sidewalk were covered in small shrimp that were drying in the sun.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257246124">
<p>
We took the boat back to Dali, then we ate lunch at Kaiyi’s.  Michael ordered a predefined lunch for us of cabbage, broccoli, eggplant and mushrooms.  We snuck a very good homemade plum wine onto the bill too.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257250332">
<p>
We ate at a street side table.  Lots of uniformed school kids were walking home for lunch, some of the children were already eating buckets of rice as they passed.  Most of the kids glanced at us as they passed; I noticed the girls were mostly glancing at me.  We were also approached by several freelance guides wanting to sell us lake tours.  An older lady first wanted to take us to her house, and then when that failed she tried to sell us bracelets.  
</p>

<p>
The most fun interaction was with a small group of Chinese tourists who say us and asked if they could take pictures with us.  We went through four rounds of posing at the table and taking pictures with lots of laughing.
</p>

<p>
After this experience I suggested to Katrina that we go down the southern gate, stand by they sheep cart guy, and charge 5 yuan for pictures with the foreigners.  We joked about getting shirts made to promote our business, and how the shirt maker might change the wording to say “these fools paid 5 yuan for this shirt, you should rip them off too!”
</p>

<p>
The tour group had planned “free time” - time without a guide – for after lunch.  On the boat ride out to the island, we had talked with Michael about other things we could do in Dali like seeing the Three Pagodas Temple or taking the gondola into the Cangshan Mountains.  Some of the problem seemed to be what transportation to use to see these places.  Michael suggested bikes, but we shot down the idea.  When we later learned that the cable car cost 110 yuan per person and the temples 130 yuan per person, we scrapped the temple visit and instead just decided to venture to the gondola.  We had Michael write the Mandarin characters for the Gong Tong gondola and for Foreigner Street so we could show the cabbies our to-and-from destinations.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257253061">
<p>
After lunch we parted with Michael, and on our own found a minibus to take us to the cableway for 15 yuan.  When we arrived, we bought tickets and tried to board the gondola, but they would not let us on!  Even though the gondola was still running, they told us to come back in 1 hour at 2pm.  We watched from the parking lot and the gondola did stop running at 1:10pm, perhaps for lunch?
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257253706">
<p>
We walked up the hill to a nearby temple which may have been Buddhist.  There were two thick eucalyptus trees in the courtyard of the rundown but evidently used temple.  We walked through a keyhole gate to the side of the temple and were surprised to find a monk walking out towards us.  I felt like I might have been caught venturing into a private garden, but the monk gestured to us to come sit down at a table in the courtyard.  He sat down with us.  The monk spoke maybe four times the amount of English that we speak Mandarin, but we laughed together about our inability to communicate.  He asked us where we were from, we asked him about what was in his book (prayers), and then for ten minutes Katrina shared pictures off her camera with the monk.  He identified the Jade Dragon Snow Mount “Yulong” and also the Tibetan monastery we passed on our hike.  At 1:30pm we said goodbye and left with the feeling that we had had a real exchange.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257255650">
<p>
We returned to the gondola and found it was now running, so we took it to the top.  Katrina was nervous about the long distances between towers on the cableway as we traveled over particularly deep gorges.  The mountains looked so much larger and steeper up close.  This range runs north/south along the lake and is cut every 2km or so by deep ravines that empty into the lake.  The mountains are also tree covered to the top.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257256338">
<p>
At the end of the gondola we first explored the nearby Qingbi stream waterfall with its incredibly clear blue water.  This canyon continues much higher up the mountain, but strangely the higher elevation segment of the stream is dry.  Was the blue water coming from an underground water source?
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257257363">
<p>
We hiked up some huge hillside staircases to the “Cloudy Tourist Path,” a nicely paved, wide stone road running horizontally across the mountain’s slope and eventually connecting to the northern gondola.  We had two and a half hours to explore, so we hustled north to the Seven Dragon Maiden Pools.  I set my wrist watch to make sure we kept on schedule – we did not want to miss the last return ride on the gondola – and we walked at a brisk 1km per 10 minutes pace.  Along the way we peered into huge canyons filled with trees, some of the trees were starting to show fall yellow.  Most of the other pathway users were tourists too, but we also passed some boys pushing a cart full of supplies.  The forest around us was mostly evergreen.  When the path cut across the steepest mountainsides, signs were posted with the warning “Dangerous, do not stop!”
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257260935">
<p>
We hiked up the gorge of the Seven Dragon Maiden Pools, first taking stairs along side of the stream and then walking on the smooth granite streambed itself.  The water was super-clear here too and the granite would have made a great waterslide if the slope had not been so steep.  The river was only partially filled, and the stream bend showed it has the potential to grow six times larger.  I took some nice pictures of the adjacent stream tributary, looking up the hazy mountain at the yellow trees glowing in the setting sun.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257263528">
<p>
At the base of the Seven Dragon Maiden Pools were several food shacks and sleeping shacks.  The place was “rustic” and a mess with strewn garbage.  It looked like many cart-boys had brought in the supplies for this station, and that some visitors were prepared to stay overnight.
</p>

<p>
We hustled back to the cableway and about halfway back I had a strong urge to use a sit down toilet.  This was serious as we did not bring any toilet paper with us and the cableway station only had Chinese-style squat toilets.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257265590">
<p>
Since we made it back to the cableway well before its 6pm final trip, Kat and I peeked up the Cangshan Grand Canyon (also dry) before taking the gondola down the hill.  Western and Eastern elevator musing was being played in the gondola.
</p>

<p>
At the bottom of the gondola, we tried to find a minibus for 15 yuan.  The only driver to approach us would not budge below 20 yuan, so we started walking for the lower parking lot were I expected I could find a different driver.  The persistent driver raced us down the stairs to the lower lot, making it clear to the lower lot busses that we were his fare and that they should not bargain with us.  We tried anyhow, but the other drivers laughed just at us.  Eventually, we relented and when with the 20 yuan ride.
</p>

<p>
The road to and from Foreigner Street is a huge eight lane boulevard with a planted center median.  Up against the mountainside edge of this road new luxury housing is being developed in astonishing quantity and size.  Most units still appear to be empty.
</p>

<p>
I really needed a bathroom by the time we were dropped off.  We rushed to our hotel room only to find our key no longer worked!  The front desk fixed the key and I finally made it to a suitable toilet.  Dali food does not agree with me, and I seem to be getting traveler’s diarrhea.
</p>

<p>
Kat and I showered, slept and then slept some more.  We decided to skip dinner, as we were not hungry and found it uninspiring that our meals seem to always be the same dishes with the same sauces.  We retired for the night at 8pm.
</p>

<p>
An aside: the problem with our Dali tours.  Our rushed Shaping Market excursion felt half-assed, the stop at the tie-dye market felt like forced shopping in a price inflated giftshop, and our Erhai Lake tour was short and lacking in depth.  Cool things we wanted to see like the Three Pagoda Temples and the Cangshan Mountain Gondola were not included in our tour at all.  Our lunches here have had predetermined menus which we cannot modify.  Then, there is lots of “free time” in each day where the tour guide disappears and we are left alone.  The guide Michael seems to be hit and miss in the information he gives us too.  We want Alvin back!
</p>

</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257325613">
<h3><a name="091104">11/4/09</a></h3>

<p>
We got up early (about 5:45am) and finished packing, then went to our so-so breakfast.  We had a few minutes after eating so we ran to the China Construction Bank and took out 1000 yuan (the maximum amount allowed by the ATM).  We had just about spent the 2500 yuan from the Beijing airport.
</p>

<p>
Michael found us at 7am, and we checked out and then drove to the airport.  Our driver took us down the eight lane highway going south along the lake.  Near the new city (which is at the lake’s end) he turned east to and followed the lake’s bottom.  All along the way new building developments like condos could be seen.  Michael says the cost is about $333 per square foot (converted) which is similar to the cost in Shanghai.  Lots of people want houses in Dali because the weather is mild and the scenery is beautiful.  Some of the people are from abroad, including a large Taiwanese contingency.  Looking into the windows it seemed that 75% of the buildings are still empty.  I wonder if this is over-building and is prime for a Miami-style bust.  On the other hand, I am in fast growing China…
</p>

<p>
The new city was also full of new towers and roads.  The city was planting along the roads and putting on a pretty face.  The airport too is gleaming and new.  When we got to it and said goodbye to the driver, it was sparkling clean with fresh marble floors.
</p>

<p>
Michael checked us in for our flight, but we quickly realized that he had only checked us through to Kunming and not onto the subsequent flight to Guilin.  We confirmed that our bags were only checked halfway too, and decided that we would recheck in at Kunming.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257325613">
<p>
We waited a while and then got on our flight to Kunming.  During takeoff we could see the numerous concrete factories in Dali that make the fuel for the building boom.
</p>

<p>
Our layover in Kunming was 4 hours long.  We rechecked in to the second flight in the baggage claim area, and then entered a ground floor lounge.  There were nice couches and a TV, so I watched NBA Basketball <editorial> (a favorite of the Chinese, as a few Chinese players are in the league) </editorial> and profishing UK for 1.5 hours while Katrina read her book about Lijiang.  At noon, we left the lounge and went searching for food.  None of the restaurants were appealing, so se ended up eating more Lay’s cucumber potato chips, pastry, and yogurt drink.  Near our gate were found a restaurant with internet service while you eat – so long and you order food.  One $5 tea later, I was writing a trip update to my family.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257346997">
<p>
Our flight left 30 minutes late.  The plane was a brand new 737-700.  We got to see the H1N1 video again, and I captured some of it on my camera.  Katrina noticed that ‘America’ is blamed for the flu at the beginning of the video.
</p>

<p>
Near Guilin, there were lots of jaggy, low lying mountains popping out of the ever-present Chinese smog.  Soon the mountains gave way to flatlands, and then the egg-crate style hills for which Guilin is famous appeared.  Instead of covering the whole horizon, they only appeared in clusters of several dozen popping out of the plain.  Some of the clusters had hills all flattened in one direction so that the hills looked more like dorsal fins.
</p>

<p>
We waited for our bags and chatted with Dean and Kim, an older couple from Raleigh NC.  Once we had our bags, we went outside and met ‘Nick,’ our new local guide.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257355457">
<p>
Nick’s Chinese name is Long somethingsomething, and he was born February 1983.  When he found out that we are all the same age, he suggested we call each other big brother, little brother and little sister.  Nick has a round face and a smile that remind us of Katrina's brother Alex.
</p>

<p>
We also met our driver Mr Wang (said “Wong”).  Mr Wang’s van is newer than the Yunnan driver’s van, and it even has seatbelts and window curtains.
</p>

<p>
The drive into town and to the Guilin Park Hotel took 40 minutes.  It brought us past road construction to improve airport access.  We also entered the karst hill lands.  Drivers here seem more chaotic, and there are many more mopeds.
</p>

<p>
On the way Nick filled us in on Guilin.  Its hills were made when the land was under water.  Volcanic uplift and lower sea levels exposed the land.  Guilin is most famous for its landscape and is among the four most important Chinese tourist cities, which include Beijing, Xian and Shanghai.  The city is in the Guangxi Minority Autonomous region.  There are four important minorities here, though I can only remember the Miao, the Zong and the Tong.  When we visit Long Chen, we will meet one of the minority peoples.  The people we will meet great guests with sweet rice wine.  They also offer you a bath in big, medium or small sized tub.  Big = you bath with the whole family.  Medium = you pick two family members and bath with them.  Small = you get into the bath tub alone and the family bathes you!
</p>

<p>
The tree of Guilin comes in four colors/types and is related to Cinnamon.  In October it flowers and makes the city smell nice.  Nick also told us about three new things (???), three old things (chili sauce, rice wine, and maybe bacon sauce), and 5 beauties (?????).
</p>

<p>
After two tries we explained to Nick that we are vegetarians.  Nick pointed out a veggie only restaurant by the Golden Gate Bridge of Guilin.  The restaurant is associated with a Buddhist temple with a red roof topped with two dragons.  The restaurant turned out to be just a 15 minute walk from our hotel, so we were determined to go there.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257357540">
<p>
Nick checked us into what is certainly our fanciest hotel so far in China.  When we got to our room, we again discovered two twin beds.  With great bed making skill, room keeping pushed the beds together for us and redid the bedding to match.  Now you can hardly feel the seam between the beds.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257357623">
<p>
At 6pm we started walking to the vegetarian Buddhist restaurant.  The walk took us along the west ring of the river.  We crossed two bridges, including the Golden Gate knock-off, and walked passed a third bridge.  The waterfront here is all pedestrian park and green space that looks pleasant for walking.  Guilin has seven knock-off bridges from famous cities around the world.  (Nick tried to sell us a 200 yuan night time boat tour, but we are shy to spend now.)  The Golden Gate knock-off is much squatter than the real think and has plants on it.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257359927">
<p>
We found the restaurant without trouble of being run over by the crazy traffic.  Inside were several large parties.  We took a small table and looked through the picture menu trying decide on the meal.  Kat and I picked out two dishes with mixtures of tofu and veggies, and then had the waitress pick out one for us too.  We ended up with a ham-esque tofu, a noodle dish with seaweed, tofu and bokchoy, and a mushroom and tofu dish picked by the waitress.  (Listed in order of least favorite to most favorite.)  All dishes were decent and all had new/different sauces from what we tried in Yunnan.  When we needed to order rice, Katrina drew a rice bowl in her notebook and showed it to the waitress – it worked!  Halfway through the meal a blind in one eye beggar came to the restaurant door.  One of the waitresses rushed over and repeatedly screamed at him, telling him to go away.  I felt embarrassed and saddened by the display.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257361822">
<p>
We walked back in the dark, enjoying the lit bridges, hotels and waterfront park/trees.  Katrina noted that the Chinese must love the lights of Vegas.  At the hotel we tried to go swimming, but found the pool access way locked.  So we took showers instead and went to bed.
</p>

</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257410380">
<h3><a name="091105">11/5/09</a></h3>

<p>
I was woken up early by the Asian cousin of Montezuma.  After emptying my bowels, I debated taking one of our travel medicines (antibiotics) or waiting a few days so that the antibiotic course would end in a western country like New Zealand.  Then I considered how pleasant diarrhea would be on today’s river cruise, so I read the find print on the antibiotic bottles.  My prescription was 5 days of Icazithromycin, with potential side effects including more diarrhea!  Katrina’s dosage was 2x daily of Ciprofloxacin for a total of 3 days, with an option to stop after 24 hours if symptoms were resolved.  I went for the quicker quick fix.
</p>

<p>
I ate a tentative breakfast of muesli, yogurt, eggs and toast with Katrina in the hotel dining room.  I used the bathroom one last time and we checked email before meeting Nick in the lobby at 8:30am.  The drive to the wharf was 40 minutes out of town, and to my disappointment actually bypassed the part of the river where we would have seen the Elephant Trunk rock.  Nick says they moved the tour start because of the amount of traffic on the boats.  The highway to the new wharf was nicely landscaped.  Guilin certainly puts on a nice face.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257412514">
<p>
There are more than 200 boats that do the trip every day.  Our departure was a 9:30am boat and it turned out that Dean and Kim from the airport yesterday are on the same cruise as we are<editorial>, in fact they are even at our table</editorial>!
</p>

<p>
We boarded the boat and were pointed to our assigned seats at a table for eight people.  Our table is on the boat’s first floor out of three floors.  We were at the head of the boat, sharing the table with Dean and Kim, a pair of Chinese men, and a Chinese couple.  The first floor of the boat was all enclosed seating, the second floor was have enclosed, half outside, and the third floor was a roof deck that was completely outside.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257414512">
<p>
Shortly after the boat embarked, we headed for the roof deck.  The river was clogged with twelve visible boats, all trying to make the same downstream journey.  Part of the problem was that the river is very shallow at this time of year, so the river is neither wide nor deep.  When we started out, we could see the rock stone riverbed of the Li River just a few feet below the surface.  Almost immediately the boats needed to form a single file line to get through shallow river section.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257414727">
<p>
During the first hour we observed how all the Li River boats are flat bottomed and draw little water.  Even so, the boats sometimes scrape along the river bottom.  All the boats have their onboard kitchens on the boat’s stern and that the crew uses river water for dish washing (and cooking too?).  The local villagers use bamboo stalks tied six-wide as rafts and they come up to the boats to sell pamelo fruit and good luck charms carved from stone.  Some of these bamboo craft have been motorized and upgraded with plastic lawn chairs and awnings.  These little craft give river tours too and play chicken with the big fifty-seater boats.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257418064">
<p>
The most interesting scenery started after the first hour of positioning and travel, with the arrival of “Woman Waiting for Husband Rock.”  Nick was on board with us, and come up top for all of the big sights to point them out and explain them to us.  The interesting portion of landscape lasted for four hours of the six hour trip.  The tall hills are a bit like Utah hills from Zion, but are more tightly spaced and covered in trees.  There is actually farm land and villages along the river, but they were hidden from view after an official told the locals to grow Phoenix Tail bamboo along the banks to make the river more beautiful.  The locals can still be seen washing clothes, letting water buffalo graze on river weed, picking river snails for food, or putting on a show with rafts and cormorants.  We also say lots of ducks, some birds of prey, butterflies and dragon flies, cows and goats from the boat.
</p>

<p>
The scenery after “Yearning for Husband” was spectacular, and seemed to be from the Dinosaur era.  We passed Deep Crown cave, but only saw its entrance.  Some nearby cliffs on the river had stalagmite like appendages.  We saw markings on the exposed cliff faces in the shape of a goldfish, then of the “Painted Hill of Nine Horses.”  Apparently, only the highest official is able to find all nine horses, lesser mortals like Bill Clinton and Nick have spotted 7.  Another hill looked like the profile of a man lying on his back.  Then we say the Xing Pink scene that is on the 20 Yuan note and the hill with a spiral like a snail’s shell.
</p>

<p>
Our day was a bit hazy, and the water was low so our sights did not match the clear sky/full rainy-season green pictures in our brochure.  We still had an immensely enjoyable time.
</p>

<p>
Along the way we talked with Nick and learned he was born in the country and has a younger brother.  He says that within one child families, the pressure to succeed and support your parents is huge.  To get into the best colleges is very hard or near impossible if you don’t have money, as high school must be paid for by the family and university is expensive too.  Need-based scholarships don’t sound available here.
</p>

<p>
A poor family of four might make 20,000 yuan per year.  A person in the middle class might make 100,000 yuan in one year for himself.
</p>

<p>
Nick hopes to travel outside of China and is trained to lead outward bound trips.  In 5 or 10 years he could be considered for an outward bound position.  His hope is to see Italy.
</p>

<p>
Nick noted that for many Chinese, travel is impossible because wages do not allow much savings and the yuan is too weak to make American or European travel affordable.  Travel is possible to Vietnam and similar countries, but Nick did not sound excited about seeing other Asian countries.
</p>

<p>
I hope Nick can travel someday!
</p>

<p>
At lunch most of the boat went to the buffet.  We had special vegetarian plates set aside for us with cauliflower, cabbage, potatoes, lotus root and other veggies.  It tasted good but I was too scared of facing diarrhea on the boat’s non-flush squat toilets to eat much.  As it was, I had taken two Imodium pills in the morning as a precaution.  (Even now, after dinner, my stomach has not demanded release.)
</p>

<p>
Katrina and I spent the whole voyage upstairs, while most of the others were inside in the air-conditioning for the last two hours.  Thirty minutes before docking, we hit another tight spot in the river.  Now a line of boats was returning from Yangshuo.  We had to wait as five of them charged up the river.  Behind us, seven boats were lined up for downstream travel.  The river was quite clogged with traffic at that point, but we finally got our turn to go.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257440509">
<p>
We got to Yangshuo and poured out into a street full of tourist stalls going as far as I could see.  Nick led us through the crowds to an electric golf cart queue, all carts heading for the city center.  We boarded a nine-seater cart which took us down Die Cul Road to the intersection with Pantao Road.  There was our hotel “New West Street Hotel.”  Nick checked us in and reminded us we would see him in two days’ time at 11:30am.
</p>

<p>
Our room is again more luxurious than we need and again has two twin beds instead of one king.
</p>

<p>
After checking in, we walked around town.  It is a tourist town through and through, full of vendors trying to sell to us.  Many of the same items from Dali like the tie-dye cloths are here too, with the same patterns as before.  Sam’s chessboard is here too.  We are started to get a feeling for the local pricing in case we wanted to bargain.  Katrina asked the price at one stall for a scarf.  The lady pulled out a sheet of paper and wrote 230 yuan, but on the same paper were previous quotes of 75, 80 and even 35.  I pointed out the other numbers and she blushed brightly.
</p>

<p>
The coolest thing here which I probably should have bought caught me by surprise.  While I was checking out some street food, some guy was observing my profile and snipping it out of a piece of paper with scissors.  It was quite accurate – what a talent!
</p>

<p>
Anyway, just like Dali and Lijiang this place is full of dumb shops.  Kat and I agree that it is most like the New Jersey Shore in terms of the concentration and focus of the shops.  I guess we just need to look beyond them all and enjoy the natural setting instead.

Nick had pointed out the Pure Lotus Vegetarian restaurant on our way into town, and that is where we dined this evening.  The restaurant is in the Magnolia Hotel, and we had the sweet and sour eggplant, green beans and bitter squash, and tofu for dinner.  Then we bummed off the Magnolia’s free internet!
</p>

<h3><a name="091106">11/6/09</a></h3>

<p>
This morning we rose later (8am) and went straight to breakfast.  After getting our plates of Chinese breakfast at the hotel’s buffet, I saw a western breakfast go by.  I scrapped the plan to eat fried noodles and we go the hostess to order us two western breakfasts.
</p>

<p>
Then we went downstairs and requested the key to our new room – we are moving to a room with a king bed.  Our new room turned out to be a smoking room, but with the windows open the smell is not too bad, and we really are tired of the two twin beds setup.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257500149">
<p>
At about 10am we rented bikes from the hotel.  The rental cost was 10 yuan for the bike and 30 yuan for the helmet!  We thought maybe we had purchased the helmet straight out, but the hotel did ask for them back at the end of the rental.  We started out walking the bikes through town, as Katrina was very nervous about riding in the chaotic city traffic.  Basically, slower road users keep further right and faster ones pass on the left.  You can get a walker being passed by a bicyclist, being passed by a moped, passed by a car all at once.  Tour buses are the fastest on the road, and you also see tricycles, water buffalo, tractors, dump trucks, and cars.  
</p>

<p>
The chaos is increased by merging customs, where no one stops before entering the flow of traffic.  Instead, the merger stays right and assumes that faster traffic will move left and give space.  People don’t even stop when entering from a side road!  Sometimes moped riders ride against traffic until they see a break in the flow, and then they move over to the appropriate side of the road.  
</p>

<p>
Mopeds also often full of families of three.  It is a wonder that we have not seen a crash (or a death and no one wears helmets).  Also, people honk often to warn you that you are being passed or that you are drifting into their space.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257503349">
<p>
Anyway, after our walk out of downtown, we rode along some major roads going southwest to Aishan Village, which is just over the Yulong River. We planned to follow a riverside bike path but could not find a marked trail.  In town, we ran into two Argentineans on a moped.  The driver said he had done this ride three years earlier and that the path was in between our current location and the river.  With this help we found a sometimes dirt, sometimes pavement road that went along the actively being harvested rice paddies, past the lime and pomelo groves, and by the taro fields.  This is the prettiest scenery of the day, where the level, colorful farm fields meet the individual tall karst hills.  We rode past people mechanically threshing rice and working the land.  Other locals had shoulder yokes with baskets on each end, and were carrying children in one basket and goods in the other.
</p>

<p>
The path kept branching and getting further away from the river, making Katrina nervous.  Our map had no details of this area.  We must have asked seven locals where we were, and the only clear answer we could understand is that which we already knew – to go back to Yangshuo we needed to turn around.  Katrina was getting very frustrated, so we turned around and retraced our steps back to town.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257511304">
<p>
On the south side of town (now it was 12pm) we headed out along the main road to the Yulong River via Butterfly Spring.  At Yulong, we turned north and followed a road along the river’s east bank.  This road was not for bikes only.  We had trucks loaded with bikes driving at us and trucks full of bamboo rafts chasing us.  This is because people bike up the river and then take rafts back down.  We watched the rafting at one artificial dam.  In the wet season the rafts could have floated over the dam and down the 3’ waterfall.  Since it is now the dry season, the water fall is gone and the boatmen have to pull the boats up and over the concrete structure.
</p>

<p>
The road first twisted between several karst hills.  Here we heard several cracks like gunfire, and then a roar of cracks like fireworks.  We think this may have been a rockslide happening nearby!  The road then emerged into fields with the river far out on our left.  We passed a woman straining under a two basket yoke of sweet potatoes.  After 30 minutes in the hot afternoon sun, the paved road dead-ended in a parking lot which services the start of the bamboo rafting tours.  Conferring with the other tourist bikers and some helpful boatmen, we determined that we had overshot Yima and were instead in Chao Yang village.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257514152">
<p>
We backtracked a short way and stopped in Yima at the Dutch owned “Giggling Tree” hostel.  We refreshed ourselves with bowls of vanilla ice cream at this rustic, mud bricked and blue trimmed establishment.  Then we asked for directions back to Yangshuo.  We followed the dirt road in front of the hostel north and east, until it joined a large paved road into the city.  The paved road cut through a dense section of hills, many pockmarked with caves, and then popped out 10 minutes later in northwest Yanshuo.
</p>

<p>
At 2:30pm we returned the bikes (“back so soon!) and retired to our room for showers, clothes washing and sleep.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257526349">
<p>
Around 5pm we ventured out into touristy Yangshuo.  Katrina tried the local gelato (eh) and we had dinner at Pure Lotus again.  The best dish was the hot and sour soup, which contained rice vermicelli, seaweed, cabbage and chili peppers and was so hot that our mouths tingled and felt spicy hot/cold!  The Buddha’s Delight and the broccoli were fine too.
</p>

<p>
We bummed internet from the Magnolia Hotel and bumped into Dean and Kim in the lobby.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257534118">
<p>
After dinner we went to inner pedestrian Yangshuo and ordered pina coladas.  The girl behind the bar had to literally run out for pineapples and spent 15 minutes preparing, taste testing and adjusting the drinks.  The result was good, but not great; however the staff deserves an ‘A’ for earnest effort.
</p>

<p>
We did a little street shopping but only bought postcards.  We are still struggling to tell what has real value and what is mass produced or faked.  I assume everything is junk now and that the prices are 4x to 10x inflated.
</p>

<p>
Oh, I took day two of the Ciprofloxacin today and did not take any more Imodium.  I’ve been all stopped up since yesterday and hope everything is still working!
</p>

</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257584691">
<h3><a name="091107">11/7/09</a></h3>

<p>
This morning I woke up first and made enough ruckus to wake Katrina too.  At 8 am we went done to breakfast.  We told the hostess that we wanted the American breakfast, so today she put us in a separate mini-dining hall where the only other guest was a man from San Francisco.  We ate our cornflakes, pastries, eggs and toast and talked a little with the man.  He suggested we climb the hill across the street from the hotel to get a good vista of Yangshuo.
</p>

<p>
<editorial>Also this morning my constipation was broken, so my worries about septic poisoning are over.  I am still finishing the three-day antibiotic course.  I did not get heartburn after last night’s hot and sour soup, so I wonder if the antibiotics are addressing my other stomach problems too!</editorial>
</p>

<p>
We went across the street looking for the path up the karst hill.  It took me 5 minutes to find it, as it was on the far side of the hill and had to be accessed through the public park.  In the park (at 9am on Saturday!) women were having a dance class, old men were playing mahjong and cards, some students were doing a team building exercise blind folded.  We climbed the 10 story hill and looked out over downtown and towards the Li River.  Dry portions of the Li’s riverbed could be seen, but no water was visible from this angle.  Today was another warm, hazy day in Yangshuo.
</p>

<p>
Next we went to the post office and mailed our latest batch of postcards.  The post office was at the end of West St, so we went down West St looking for last-minute souvenirs from China.  We kind of had the feeling that this was our last chance to get Asian/Chinese souvenirs since our Vietnam trip is so full and we did not expect much gift variety at Long Sheng rice terraces.
</p>

<p>
Our first purchase was a wood cutting/carving for Katrina’s parents (100 yuan).  It is a circular item with dragons inside.  Then Katrina went into a doodad shop and found carved wooden monkeys that she liked.  She bought five for her girlfriends and I got two thinking I could give them to Aunt Robin and maybe Rose.  This store was a ‘no bargaining’ store, but they gave us a 10% discount for buying seven monkeys anyway (180 yuan).
</p>

<p>
Lastly Katrina reentered a bamboo inlay shop (the inlays look like paintings made of bamboo) she had explored last night.  We each found small pieces that we linked (small so that they will carry home more easily) and negotiated 80 yuan for the set of them.  Perhaps I will give mine to Rose or Toby.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257587862">
<p>
We hustled back to the room and met Nick downstairs at 11:30am.  He had planned to take us to lunch right away, but since we were not hungry, he agreed to postpone the lunch until we were entering the Long Sheng area.
</p>

<p>
The drive to Long Sheng requires four hours of travel to the northwest, skirting past Guilin and the airport at the halfway point.  The first half of the trip was on a small highway going through the karst hill farmland.  Nick talked to us about the minority people in the Long Sheng area, reminding us that the Zhong are the least minority minorities amongst the Yao (?), Miao and Tong.  Traditionally different minorities lived at different elevations on the mountain slopes.  In one subgroup of the Miao, the women never cut their hair except when they are 16 years old and then again just before they die.  Their hair is thus almost as long as they are tall!  The Tong are known for their fine construction and house building skills.
</p>

<p>
During this portion of the drive we passed several new campuses for Guilin universities including the new campus for Nick’s tourism school.  We again talked about the high cost of schooling and how there is little financial aid in China.  Later we got on to the subject of taxes, and learned that China has a graduated tax system similar to the US, where bigger earners pay a large percent of their income in taxes.
</p>

<p>
Near Guilin we got on a restricted expressway.  Here the speed limits were as high as 120kph but our driver never went above 80kph.  I think he was trying to save fuel, because he also downshifted into neutral whenever possible and incessantly lugged the engine under acceleration.  This annoyed me because our trip would have been faster if he had done the speed limit.
</p>

<p>
<editorial> Along the highway we saw a man standing in a pond with a backpack and a long metal rod.  We asked Nick what the man was doing, and he said he was fishing using electricity!  Apparently, this uproots fish within five meters of the device!  Nick then told us how when he lived in the countryside as a kid, he would do things like tethering a mouse on a string with a bunch of sticky glue on the mouse’s back, and then use the mouse as a lure to catch eagles!  He would also go a steal and roast sweet potatoes, and use pesticides to go fishing in the rivers.  Nick seemed pleased about these childhood adventures.</editorial>
</p>

<p>
Nick asked me if I had a car and I admitted to having two.  He is hoping to take the driver’s license test this coming year – I cannot tell if time or money is slowing his progress.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257600832">
<p>
North of Guilin we exited the highway and started onto a two lane road past many citrus and watermelon farms.  We pulled over and bought a pomelo (6 yuan) to try.  I was nervous at first that the vender was contaminating the large yellow fruit when she cut it open for us and removed the skin.  A pomelo is like an oversized grapefruit and has similar bitter white peel and section dividers.  Nick showed us how to remove as much white bits as possible, and then to open the segment and eat the internals without eating the bitter casing too.  I though it tasted like a grapefruit, only less juicy.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257602429">
<p>
The road entered the mountains and climbed for thirty tense minutes of twisties.  Our slow driver lugged the engine up the hills, lugged it during nail-biting slow passing maneuvers approaching blind corners, and then descended in neutral on the brakes the whole time.  At one point, Katrina and I both had to scream “car!” because he was pulling out to pass when oncoming traffic was rounding a corner.
</p>

<p>
The mountains here were the more typical “AAA” shaped mountains.  The house construction changed to wood and in many places we could see bamboo forests too.  Locals were harvesting trees and bamboo for lumber.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257604586">
<p>
We did and equally long descent and then turned on to a small road winding up a river ravine.  This road took us to the Long Sheng welcome center, which was also our lunch location.  We ate in a riverside building, looking out on the rice terraces climbing the hill on the opposite bank of the river.  We could also see locals turning over rocks in the river to flush our little fish.
</p>

<p>
Our lunch was Chinese ratatouille, rice, rubbery mushrooms, a melon dish, other melon-like slivers, and mushroom vermicelli soup.  Basically it was OK and we did not clean our plates.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257607467">
<p>
We drove a little more and then walked across a cable bridge into a long-haired Miao village.  The ladies were selling the same gifts from everywhere else in China; the men were preparing lumbar for building.  (It seems like the whole valley is building right now!)  The Miao women wear read outfits and put their hair up so we did not see its length.  Most of the women were older.  House here have animals living on the first floor, people living on the second floor, and grain stored on the third floor.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257608552">
<p>
We drove another 20 minutes of switch backs up towards Long Ji town.  At the end of the road, we grabbed our packs, bid the driver Mr Wang goodbye, and started hiking up the main road/staircase into the village 500 feet above.  We passed sedan chairs and women offering to carry our luggage.  Katrina and Nick were quickly winded by the climb, we all were soon sweaty in the hot and humid air.
</p>

<p>
Half of the climb was through the village of Ping An.  The several story houses here are on stilts on the hillside and are of all-wood construction.  At one point we passed two men taking a blow torch to a dead dog in an effort to remove the fur or cook the dog.  This is the first evidence we have seen of the Chinese eating dogs.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257611086">
<p>
Our room in the Ping An Guesthouse is #309, and the whole rooms smells of the cedar of the walls, floors and ceiling.  The floors creak when you walk.  The sound insulation is almost none, so you can hear the (typically loud) Chinese guests next door.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257612209">
<p>
At about 4:30pm, we climbed from the guesthouse up to the Seven Stars and Moon viewing platform to watch the sunset.  The rice terraces are mostly cut and dry right now – the may very well be the least interesting season to see them in – but they still make quite an impression for the way they transform the flowing topography into level rings.  All along the walkway were opportunities to take photos with girls in minority costume.  We skipped these opportunities and instead indulged on ice cream bars as our dinner.  We are down to our last 250 yuan and want to stretch it until we leave China.
</p>

<p>
<editorial>While inquiring at one concession stand if they had a particular ice cream bar, I had my most exciting Mandarin language comprehension moment so far!  The vender said “mei yuo" when I pointed at the picture of the bar, and I recognized those words to mean “we don’t have that”.  I was so excited that I repeated “mei yuo” back to her and she laughed when she realized I understood! </editorial>
</p>

<p>
There were plenty of foreign tourists out too, including a Utah couple who had recently ended a mission in Uganda.
</p>

<p>
We returned to the guesthouse, sent emails from the cigarette-infused computer nook, and then showered and went to bed.  I am itchy and worried that there are no-see-ums in our room!
</p>

</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257615059">
<h3><a name="091108">11/8/09</a></h3>

<p>
This morning the guesthouse gave us western breakfast of toast, jam and egg.  We also tried some local tea, which does not steep very long, and whose leaves often finds its way into your mouth when you drink it.  We washed clothes at 8am, then at 9am met Nick to begin our hike.  
</p>

<p>
Our hike took us west along the rice terraces to Long Ji Village.  We walked mostly horizontally across the slope, but did lose some altitude along the way.  The rice has already been harvested and so most of the terraces just have the cut rice stalks left.  A few of the terraces were flooded with water, for reasons I don’t know.  We saw people moving back and forth with yolks of sweet potato greens.  These greens are chopped, dried and then used to feed pigs.  We also passed a few huts on the hillside.  These are outside of the village and are used to store harvested crops, since they are more convenient than taking the good all the way back to the village.  Villagers might also eat lunch in the huts on the long harvest days. 
</p>

<p>
For the first half of our hike, a golden colored puppy followed us.  Katrina thought he was cute, and talked of taking him home to her parents.
</p>

</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257672157">
<p>
We crossed another “Wind and Rain” bridge, built in ~1960.  This bridge had a plaque saying which family had donated so much money or labor to construct the bridge.  The plaque was written in right-to-left form even though the writing order had been changed during the Cultural Revolution.  This is because the country side often got information much later. 
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257673801">
<p>
We also passed a number of tombs which were built into the hillside.  Most tombs have a coffin sized door with memorial inscription on them.  The door is often ornamented with lions or dragons.  The fanciest tombs are from land owners.  Before the government took over the land, land was owned by 5% of the population.  Today the government rents out the land to individuals for 30-50 year periods.
</p>

<p>
In some ways the local landscape reminds me of Northern California.  Now the colors are the same, with the dry gold grass, the tall evergreens and the fern undergrowth.  Also, the mountains style and haze/fog are similar.  Maybe the insect and bird sounds (from crickets and crows) ring bells too.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257674252">
<p>
On the outskirts of Long Ji village, we saw construction starting on a new house.  They were still leveling the land for the foundation.  Houses here are big, holding 10 inhabitants, plus animals on the ground floor.  Building a modern house may cost nearly 600,000 yuan or $100,000.  50% of the cost comes from transporting materials out of the valley road and up to the village.  One horse might carry two large foundation stones at a 20 yuan cost.  Big key beams are bought, but less structurally important members might be cut for free from local forests and hand milled by the locals to removed bark and make the wood round (or cut planks).  
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257675338">
<p>
In the village we saw another house under construction.  It was about three months along and had the key structural internals in place and the roof finished.  There were no walls or floors yet.  This Zhang (Zhuang?) house was built without nails.  Notching in the wood holds the house together.
</p>

<p>
Long Ji is bigger than Ping An, but less touristy since access is harder.  They are currently working on a road up from the valley, but it does not look wide enough to support two-way traffic or tour busses.  Maybe the road will lower the construction costs?  The down itself is rustic, mainly farming house with a few stores and one guesthouse.  There were many chickens clucking around and a few dogs too.  Electricity only came to the village in 1985, then came cell phones.  It was just five years ago that wired phones arrived.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257676789">
<p>
We walked a little beyond the village to a large tomb from 2006.  Nearby was a hillside fish farm.  Then we turned back to Pin An and did the return trip in one hour (half the time it took us to arrive).
</p>

<p>
Along the way Nick asked me when I was planning to have children.  While I don’t know, Nick is currently dating a 23 year old woman that works in a Guilin hotel.  They have plans to marry in two years, then have children in the following year.  Kids are a couple’s social security in China.  For weddings in China, it is usually the man’s family that pays.  In northeast China, the man’s family first pays 50,000 yuan to the girl’s family as a down payment.  This money will be used to help the couple furnish and equip their home.  Then the man’s family is on the hook for another 50,000 yuan for a grand wedding feast.  Kat and I don’t know how long the man’s families have been shouldering this cost.  Is it a result of the one child policy?
</p>

<p>
Back in Ping An, we hiked up the hill to the viewpoint #2, “Seven Stars Accompanying Moon.”  The “stars” in the equation are the small circular terraces at the top of small elevation gains on the hillside.  The “moon” is actually the real moon.
</p>

<p>
We then traversed the hill going northeast to “Nine Dragons and Five Tigers.”  In this view the “dragons” are the spines formed by the hill’s topography, and the “tigers” are the points which were called “stars” at the other viewpoint!  This traversal was nicer because the terraces were steeper and not as overgrown with grasses.  Some farmers were out tending their terraces, and some horses were munching in the terraces too.  The farmers here carry hand scythes (that look scary!) and have stocking-shaped wicker baskets for the safe carrying of the tool.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257682248">
<p>
Also along the traversal we passed a half-dozen red Miao women with long hair.  They pestered us asking “long hair, long hair?” wanting payment for a peep show.  Ignoring them just resulted in one of them bonking me with her hand.  Paying them attention just increased their efforts.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257682514">
<p>
The view from Nine Dragons and Five Tigers is nice, looking into Ping An village and also letting us see our guesthouse.  I wanted to hike into the next set of villages to the west (the Jinkeng area) but Nick said it takes more than four hours to get there and is not straight forward.  It was also about 1pm, so we hiked the thirty minute return back to Ping An.  Along the way we asked Nick if there were any Chinese minorities that are anti-technology in the way the Amish are.  Nick said no, there are not, but he was interested in learning more about the Amish.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257684207">
<p>
For lunch we ate at Dazu restaurant and had mapo tofu (spicy and heartburn testing – perhaps the antibiotics have kicked my heartburn?), broccolini, roasted green peppers, egg and scallion omelet.  The eggs were the best.  There were lots of hornets buzzing around, but our table was out of their way.
</p>

<p>
We returned to the guesthouse and tried some sweet rice wine.  This was clouding like soy milk, a little bubbly and also more like beer than wine.  I liked it more than Katrina, and got a little tipsy.  Katrina admitted to Nick that he looks like her brother, then went online to show Nick a picture of Alex.  Nick agreed that there were similarities!  Nick is truly a nice guy, but I wonder if some of our affinity for him is granted because of his familiar looks.
</p>

<p>
We had been prodding all day to fill the afternoon’s empty hours and the empty hours for tomorrow morning with activities.  Nick got the hint and moved up tomorrow’s departure.  We will visit a local tea village and also a Bears and Tigers village.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257697082">
<p>
At 3pm we relaxed in our room, then at 4pm we went back out to the Nine Dragons view to watch the sunset.  Yet another dog joined us on our climb; we named her Dotty.  Along the way we say one farmer digging up potatoes and another burning the grasses in his terrace.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257697911">
<p>
At Nine Dragon and Five Tigers, we were again surrounded by four long haired ladies wanting to sell us photographs.  We continued up and along the path, hoping to see some new land and to get away from the ladies.  Very shortly we came around the hillside and found an excavator digging a road up the hillside.  I watched and soon counted four large dump trucks cycling between the excavator and a large parking lot about one mile down the road that they were building on the hillside using the freshly excavated dirt.  The excavator seemed to be working to improve an existing dirt road that continued up the hill.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257699000">
<p>
I caught up with Katrina at a higher overlook of the Nine Dragons view.  We watch as the sun started going down and then began hearing musing and firecrackers in Ping An below.  At 5:30, we headed back down the hill to see what all the ruckus was about.  As we entered the town and its narrow streets, a parade was coming around the corner in the opposite direction.  Women in white were carrying large brightly colored circular garlands of metallic materials.  These were items that we had noticed early at the tombs.  We the saw men, clashing cymbals and playing pipes, and an elderly man lighting strings of firecrackers as he walked.  (I was hit by some of the debris from the fireworks but not hurt.)  When we got back to the guesthouse, Nick informed me that we saw a funeral parade.
</p>

<p>
For dinner, we ate at Mei You restaurant, were we ordered onion rings and eggplant pizza.  The onion rings seemed to be battered in pancake dough, the catsup might have had tomatoes in it, and the pizza was just OK.  We should have stuck to Chinese food in this village.
</p>

<p>
Back at the guesthouse, we read email.  Henry asked me a number of questions about the construction, durability, and age of the terraces.  I answer what I could, and then found Nick (he was talking with Dean and Kim’s guide on the guesthouse porch) to get answers for the others.  I learned that the terraces were built from 800 years ago to 200 years ago, and that they have the same stone construction as the foundations we saw today.
</p>

<p>
Also related to the funeral, we keep hearing shots in the night in sets of three.  Are they killing animals for a feast? 
Anways, off to bed now!

<editorial>Continuing health saga: no heart burn after the mapo tofu.  This morning I had a small (1/3 expected size) bm, and I still am mostly constipated.  Last bm was same small size and two mornings ago. Update: reg size achieved this morning.</editorial>
</p>

<p>
Nick came by a little earlier because he had received a call that the driver had arrived. We had been up since sunrise (6:30am) since the village was banging drums and lighting three loud fireworks every 30 minutes or so.  Nick told us this morning that actually two elder members of the village had died yesterday!  I wondered if the loud fireworks helped notify other villages of the deaths.
</p>

<p>
We had breakfast around 8am.  The table next to us had an American family with two adopted Chinese girls.  I wonder what the daughters thought of China.
</p>

<p>
At 8:30am Nick told us the car had arrived, so we got our bags and hustled down the hill to the parking area.  Along the way Nick asked me more questions about Henry’s terraces.  Nick also told me that when it rains in Long Ji, it does so for only a few hours, then stops or drizzles.  They may not get the steady week-long rains of Northern California.  I wonder if the Long Ji rice terraces could withstand that type of deluge.
</p>

<p>
Our car was a rebadged Mazda Protégé driven by Ms Liu.  Ms Liu likes to drive in the middle of the road, drives quicker than our previous driver, and passes often.  I was a little on edge with her driving, but mostly OK.  On the main road to Guilin we climbed the mountains in to the opening rain clouds.  It drizzled, then rained and then, at the crest of the mountain road, was very dense with fog.  As we descended the mountain the rain disappeared.
</p>

<p>
On the way down we passed another large dump truck tipped sideways since its left wheels had driven into the ditch along the lane going in the opposite direction.  I suspect a passing maneuver gone awry – Nick blamed it on sleepy drivers.  Later we passed a second accident between a flatbed truck and a motorcycle!
</p>

<p>
Nick and I compared notes on cars.  Cars here are a little more expensive than what they would be in the US.  Chinese buyers almost never use bank loans on cars; bank loans are just for houses.  House loans might be ~20 years long, depending on the down payment size.  Just like in the US, young couples often start life in the city.

<p>
Our first stop was at the Liu Sanjie Tea Plantation.  It has three small hills of tea, and the tea is picked in summer, spring and fall.  Once picked, the tea goes through one to three days of drying, tumbling/fermenting, cooking to dry, then pressing.  We then tasked four types of tea: local osimanthis and ulong, jasmine tea, black tea with lychee, and ginseng ulong.  My favorites were the local and lychee teas.  Each tea was added loose to a small pot, then rinsed in hot water.  Next the rinse water was poured away, and the steeping water was added for 30 second to 2 minutes depending on the type of tea.  The brewed tea was separated from the leaves and served in a super small, half-shot sized, tea cup.  Katrina and I both bought tea for our relatives; the cost was 100 yuan to 180 yuan per canister.  We thought this was expensive, but Nick started talking about how good tea was often 1,000 yuan per 500 grams, and as much as 10,000 yuan for 500 grams.  Our tea cost closer to the 1,000 yuan/500 grams mark.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257765365">
<p>
Our next stop was the “Tigers and Bears Mountain Village”.  This was not at all what we had imagined!  We were expecting a village in the mountains but no tigers or bears.  Instead we got 1,000 tigers and 120 bears and no mountain or village!  The zoo markets itself as an eco-park and educational center, but so many unwild cats seemed odd.  Nick thinks that some of the animals are released back into the wild.  I get the sense that they are breeding the animals so that they can sell products like bear heart wine and tiger heart wine.  Tiger teeth are also worth $200 or so.  
</p>

<p>
We walked past more than 20 or 30 enclosures of tigers, many cages with almost 20 cats inside.  Most were Chinese tigers, but some white tigers were there too.  Also, some cubs could be seen.  They were mostly lying about, sleeping sprawled in the shade, trying to keep still in the 80F heat and humidity.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257767479">
<p>
We saw equally lazy lions (all sleeping) and then two large enclosures with moats filled with black bears.  A few bears were wading in the water or tackling each other, but most were sprawled about, resting in strangely human postures on their backs or sitting up against trees.  At on corner of an enclosure were bamboo poles with apple halves attached at the end of strings.  10 yuan for bear fishing!  The attendant tried to show us how to feed the bears by swinging the apple in front of the nose of a sleeping bear she called “the queen bear.”  Queeny completely ignored the food, event when it swung into her face and hit her on the nose!  Annoyed, the vender poked the bear in the foot with the pole, causing Queeny to sit up (human style) but still refuse to eat the apple.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257771309">
<p>
At 12:30 we left the zoo and went looking for a restaurant.  On the main road Nick found a street side eatery.  It was busy, with local blue collar workers.  We ordered and sat outside, where there were less flies.  The mapo tofu and eggplant were the best, the long beans so-so and the egg and tomato soup made for just too much food.  W ate as much as was comfortable, then sat back and watched a little girl of about two years old chase chickens and check out me and my blue eyes.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257775522">
<p>
Nick dropped us off at the airport at about 2pm.  We wrote him a short but positive review, thanking him for our tour and encouraging the agency to send Nick to Italy as an outbound tour guide.  We tipped Nick 300 yuan, took group pictures on both our camera and on his, and he asked us for a hug (!) and said he would like to lead us again if we return to Guilin.  I know we have a local friend, and I hope that somehow the friendship will be maintained.  We did enjoy the company and the ability to share local experiences.  I hope Nick gets to Italy and maybe to Boston too.  Nick suggests we return in May or September for the best Long Ji experience.
</p>

<p>
At the airport I started reading “among the Nakhi of Likiang,” then we checked into our flight to Hanoi via Hong Kong.  They were just going to check the bags to Hong Kong, but Kat got them to figure out how to check them all the way to our destination instead.  In the international terminal, we checked out the overpriced gifts and I priced out duty free booze to see if it differs from city to city.  Here in Guilin, Cointreau 700ml costs  120 yuan and Baileys 1L costs 280 yuan (for a two pack?).
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257790564">
<p>
The flight to Hong Kong left at sunset (6:30pm) and arrived very quickly, after maybe only fifty minutes of flying.  During the landing we might have seen downtown Hong Kong way off in the distance lit up over the water.  We were sitting on the left side of the plane, and we did see many boats on the bay.  There is no time change to Hong Kong.  In the duty free here, the bottle of Baileys was HK $180.  We think 1 yuan is stronger than HK $1.  Perhaps HK $100 = 90 yuan? 
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257797466">
<p>
The Hong Kong airport is very large, and is culture shock modern.  Everything is clean and shiny, if somewhat bland.  We went into the shopping and food court area and found it to be like an upscale mall.  We bought four muffins for tomorrow’s breakfast (HK $99) and a HK Disney mug as a gift for Auntie (HK $90, or about USD $12.50).  Then we had a big-city priced curry and naan, which was tasty.  We kind of kicked ourselves for not ordering a salad too, since the produce here is probably safe.
</p>

<p>
Being in this airport is an odd, first-world deja vu before we go on to Vietnam.  Kat and I are both pining for this familiar atmosphere and kind of wishing we could stay in Hong Kong for a few days.  (The bathrooms are so clean!)
</p>

<p>
I keep seeing white/American people pass by in the airport and then wonder, why are they here so far away from home?
</p>

<p>
The flight to Hanoi was pretty short, only 1.5 hours.  As soon as we landed the air smelled familiar, maybe it had the same coal-powered scent as in Beijing.  There was some pollution haze, but not as hugely thick as in China.  The passport control guards sat in worn cubicles, with plain and slightly threadbare uniforms.  The Vietnam immigration documents asked us to write in black or green ink!  
</p>

<p>
Once out of the baggage claim we met the driver’s assistant, holding a sign with Katrina’s name.  We go cash at an ATM – 3 million ‘dong’, or about $170, and even then we were approached by a taxi offering us a hotel.  Hanoi is apparently full of scam artist taxis that kidnap you and take you to a partner hotel.
</p>

<p>
The driver had a Toyota van, and took us 40 minutes along the highway to Hanoi.  There were 2-4 story buildings all the way, all very narrow and in an ornate colonial style.  However, all of the neighborhoods were completely dark (it was 12am) and only the main highways had streetlights.  The lack of lights makes this sprawling city rather spooky.  From the air everything looked awfully dark too, almost as if they had been expecting an air raid.  Along the highway we also passed Canon and Panasonic factories.
</p>

<p>
On the rid I noticed there were no stoplights or stop signs.  It was probably this way in Guanxi too.  Mopeds generally take the right lane, cars take the left.  A combination of high beams, passing blinkers, and honking is used to make slow cars move into the moped lane.  At intersections, the biggest vehicle wins, forcing its way into the flow of traffic and causing the others to yield.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257812685">
<p>
We made it to Hotel Elegant and were greeted by the night manager and bell boy.  The hotel is also a narrow colonial building on a small street in the old city.  All the surrounding businesses were closed for the night.  The night manager spoke decent English, talked to us about arranging the payment, and showed us our room and its amenities.  The room is tight, but very clean and modern.  It even has its own computer for internet (we sent out we-are-alive-still emails).
</p>

<p>
We showered, set three alarms for 5:15am and went to bed at 1am.
</p>

</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257811200">
<h3><a name="091110">11/10/09</a></h3>

<p>
Katrina’s cell phone alarm rung at 5am, 15 minutes before I expected.  We had different ideas about how long it takes to get up, dressed and then literally cross the street to the Hanspan office.  It made me a bit frustrated that some of the extra time she wanted/needed was to check the news online.  I think she wanted to be sure her parents knew she was safe in Hanoi.
</p>

<p>
At 5:55am we went downstairs and found the four night staffers all sleeping on the lobby floor, sharing common bedding!  It was rather cute, actually.  Unfortunately, we woke them up on our way out.
</p>

<p>
The Hanspan office was closed and locked to our confusion.  A passerby on a moped stopped to sell us a hotel, then, 10 minutes late, Anh showed up and introduced himself as our guide.  Anh is about 35 years old, a bit weathered, carries a North Face backpack and has Teva style sandals.  Shortly, we boarded a Ford Transit van and started the two hour drive to the port (Hai Phong?) where we would catch the hydrofoil to Cat Ba Island.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257833562">
<p>
The drive took us east along a major highway.  At that time in the morning, people were heading to work.  After major intersections in the highway, bread vendors would park on the road and wait for passersby to stop for loaves of French bread.  According to Anh, the French bread in Vietnam is very good, because the French colonized Vietnam and now the Vietnamese “have the technology.”
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257834495">
<p>
The whole highway to Hai Phong port city (the largest port in North Vietnam) is lined with factories, then in between are colonial buildings with eating, living and hotel space.  The biggest factories were drawing hundreds of commuting workers into their main gates.  Masses of people on mopeds and bicycles entered the factories too.
</p>

<p>
The highway was divided with two lanes in each direction.  Generous bike lanes flanked the hwy, and were separated from the automobile traffic by barriers.  Here cars stay in the innermost/left lane of the highway, mopeds use the outermost/right lane or avoid the highway altogether and drive down the bike lane instead.  Bikes and walkers stayed in the bike lanes.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257836195">
<p>
At major intersections (and minor ones too), bikes and mopeds would line up along the side of the road waiting for a break in the traffic.  When a break does come, they rush out to the highway median in mass, of the accumulating too many vehicles for the median space and blocking the cars in the highway’s left lane.  If the country used stop lights more often this behavior could be avoided.  When a truck or a car approaches a busy intersection, the driver will lay into the horn to discourage the bikers and mopedists from crossing in front of them.
</p>

<p>
The highway has a concrete center divider topped with a tall fence.  The fence’s purpose appears to be to stop pedestrians and mopeds from crossing the highway at any which point.  It mostly succeeds at its purpose, but some daring people still climb the fence or squeeze through holes in the structure while cars and trucks buzz past on both sides!
</p>

<p>
This divider and fence also result in mopeds driving counter-flow to their factories.  Intersections on the highway are spaced a mile apart or so with no breaks in the center divider to allow access to businesses on the far side of the highway.  Thus, if you need to go left on the highway to access your factory, and the factory is not too far off down the road, the shortest path is to just dive in and drive against traffic!
</p>

<p>
At least most mopedists wear helmets.  Anh says that the helmet fine here costs more that the purchase price of a helmet.
</p>

<p>
One of the factories we passed was Ford, most others made steel products, and some make textiles or chemicals.  All of the factories advertise ISO 9001 compliance.
</p>

<p>
Hanoi is now a town of 10 million people, as the government recently enlarged its official boarders.  Once we were one hour from the city center, I started to see farms of rice and corn.  Big horned cattle grazed in the fields.  I saw one woman herding five of the cattle down the bike-path while riding a bike herself!  Another person had a special big pig trailer made for his moped and was busy transporting a pig!
</p>

<p>
A few war signs can be seen.  Very close to the Hanoi city center was a bridge built by Eiffel (of Eiffel Tower fame) that had been bombed in the war.  The few surviving sections I could see had Eiffel Tower like lattice framework; the repaired sections of the bridge were just plain causeway spans as the bridge’s original plans had been lost.  Also, every 20 minutes or so we would pass a war memorial obelisk with a red star on top and what looked like a graveyard below.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257842765">
<p>
We got to the port 50 minutes early, so we ate tea, eggs and bread in a hotel café while we waited.  When we did finally board the hydrofoil, we were some of the last on and thus had the backward facing seats at the bow of the enclosed hydrofoil.  Lots of Dutch and American tourists were onboard with us too.  Directly across from us were a Vietnamese mother with her infant, an older woman and man.  The boat went very quickly through the port, but when it reached open water the waves increased to five foot swells.  The boat could not maintain full speed in these conditions.  The rocking of the vessel was rather intense, and was combined with diesel fumes and hot (maybe 80*F) humid air.  Inside, the air conditioning helped with the temperatures, but did not improve the rocking or the fumes.  Kat had taken a Dramamine but still felt queasy.  I tried stroking her hand as she closed her eyes, and the Vietnamese woman sitting directly across from me gave me pointers on which palm and wrist pressure points I should press for best effect.  The mother with the infant threw up!
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257846998">
<p>
After 50 minutes we arrived at Cat Ba Island.  The islands size, rockiness, colonial building style and paint colors, all reminded me of the Caribbean.  We took a 5 minute bus ride to the other side of the island, waited for a little bit, then boarded a motorized cruise boat of about 35’ long that slowly puttered to the resort island.  We sat on the boat’s flat roof and reveled at the gray limestone islands covered in dark green foliage, in the murky green waters and the threatening clouds, the floating fish and oyster farm villages.
</p>

<p>
Anh told us that this area is protected by the government, and that fishermen had to stop traditional fishing and start farming.  Those that did were set up by the government with small floating houses.  Attached to each house are buoy rigs that support the fish nets and sand-filled oyster baskets.  Oysters are a new product to these farms which were introduced because having so many fish farms in the same area was making it easy for fish disease to spread quickly.  The government had offered these floating houses as a one time deal, so new fish farmers have to set up their own lodgings and sometimes live in simpler tent-like shacks.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257850348">
<p>
We arrived at our island Nam Cat (which means “five sands”) at about 11 am.  It was high tide at that time.  <editorial>There is no dock, so our boat pulled bow first up to the beach.  They put down a narrow gang plant from the flat front of the boat onto the sand, and then Katrina and I, burdened with our hiking backpacks, tried to disembark down the narrow hen-house-esque ramp as the boat moved back and forth in the surf!  We both made it to shore dry, but it made for a moment of excitement.</editorial>
</p>

<p>
The island is a narrow strip of beach with eight or so thatched roof huts for sleeping, a large open thatch-roofed dining area and bar, and a kitchen building.  There are also four dogs and a number of kayaks on the island.  The staff is currently building a new floating pier so that boats can land at the island during low tide.  They are also building a series of cottages on stilts over the water and the rocks of the cliff.  These new cottages will help space out the lodgings.  The camp/resort is in the Cat Ba National Park and is thus part park and part privately owned.  It used to be only serviced by Handspan, but now other companies come here too.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257854783">
<p>
We rested until the 12pm lunch, when we had tofu, vinegar cucumber presented in a romantic heart shape, seasoned greens, fried peanuts and eggs.  We digested until 2pm and watched some Austrians arrive by boat for lunch and then to take out kayaks.  At 2pm Anh showed us proper paddle technique – pull with your upper torso, not with your arm muscles – then settled us into a double seater kayak.
</p>

<p>
I put my camera into a dry bag and strapped our rain coats onto the boat just in case the clouds decide to open, then we set out for a two hour paddle.  I was in the back seat and I had trouble getting comfortable in the very upright seat.  Furthermore, there was little room to move my legs or bend my knees.  The kayak has a rudder which is operated by the foot supports, but these were in the narrower edges of the boat and were difficult for me to operate.  We made it for the whole two hour trip, but not without Katrina getting peeved about my steering and me getting grouchy about the kayak space issues.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257857737">
<p>
Anyway, the scenery was great.  The islands look like mini New Zealand fiords when seen from water level.  Eagles soar overhead fishing crabs, and barnacles can be seen on water level rocks.  Some of the islands have caves and with interior lagoons that we will visit tomorrow or the next day.  The water here is only five meters deep in places and there a 10’ difference high and low tides.  We saw a few beaches here and there, but Anh tells us the fishermen are moving sand to good oystering locations.  The landscape could become another rice filled Guilin if the water levels dropped enough and exposed the sea floor.
</p>

<p>
The open sea nearby is called the Bay of Tonkin, and is just a five minute kayak paddle away.  The islands are home to macaques monkeys and also langur monkeys.  We have not spotted either yet.
</p>

<p>
We got back to the camp at 4:30pm and ordered local island-special drinks from the bar.  The color of the drinks is green like the sea water.  We then relaxed until shower and journal time.
</p>

<p>
At 6:30pm it was dinner time and already dark.  The only other guests here are an English couple of our age.  We have not talked with them.  We ate all sorts of fried egg rolls, onion, potato and then some cabbage and Chinese apple.  The generator was running (off and on!) powering the lights and the TV playing music videos.
</p>

<p>
After dinner, we went out on the beach to see the stars, but the camp lights are too bright.  Anh told us that the water here is bio luminescent, and we hope to see it.  The tide is completely out now (it is 7:30pm) and the beach is about twice the size it was when we arrived.  Unfortunately, I feel like my legs are getting munched on!
</p>

<p>
Our hut has two twin mattresses on a raised wood floor.  In the back of the hut down at ground level is a bathroom partition with a sink, toilet and shower head.  The shower sprays right on to the concrete floor but unfortunately the floor does not drain properly!  We have a half inch deep puddle in between the doorway and the toilet.  There is no hot water in the bathroom.  The room also comes with a big mosquito net which hangs from the four corners of the room.  I have not seen a mosquito yet, but we are using the net anyway!
</p>

</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257928112">
<h3><a name="091111">11/11/09</a></h3>


<p>
Last night it was really hot under the mosquito net.  We were woken up a few times, once by a heavy rain pour.  We slept in until about 8am, then when out to see what was for breakfast.  We were served fried eggs and toast.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257933936">
<p>
Anh told us we would be kayaking to the big boat.  At about 9:30am we headed out, going mainly east (it turns out our beach faces south).  We paddled here and there for about two hours, including checking out a lagoon accessed by a cave with a very low roof.  Anh told us how the locals sometimes damn up a whole lagoon to use as a fish farm; the downside to this approach is that it is harder to catch the fish!
</p>

<p>
Katrina took the kayak’s rear seat this morning, which worked much better.  There were no steering problems and if I wanted to put my legs cross-ways or wiggle them around I could. Also, I think the front simply has more knee room.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257937534">
<p>
We found our boat, which was bigger than the one from yesterday.  The big boat had ~10 interior dining tables and a crew of three.  The interior was a beautiful deep dark wood.  Since it was early (only 11am) and Katrina and I did not want to go swimming ( I hat putting a shirt back on after swimming in salt water) we motored early for Ha Long Bay, which is north of our current location in Cat Ba Park.  The water outside of the islands is exposed to the Bay of Tonkin and had big rolling waves, so the captain decided to take us to a second favorite spot as we could get there without crossing so much open, rolling water.  I though it a shame that we did not see the #1 favorite spot, as the island mountains to the northwest across the broad inlet looked extra tall.  Apparently the tallest Ha Long mountains are 1000 feet high.  Instead, we went west along the edge of the big inlet and then ducked into a calm cove where five other motorized junks had anchored.  Anh explained that Ha Long Bay gets more tourist traffic than Cat Ba.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257940496">
<p>
The cove was very beautiful with clean water (no rubbish like in our beach), tall island with 45-degree scouring on the rock faces, green jungle foliage and a few eagles swooping around looking for fish.  We had a lunch of cucumbers, more tofu, rice, omelet, green veggies, fried peanuts and apple.  There was also “old person soup” of carrots and potatoes.  The meal was decent if repetitive.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257945871">
<p>
At 1:30pm, we paddled up the cove into a tall and long cave that lead to a lagoon.  Anh had said he had spotted a monkey on our island this morning, so we were determined to spot a monkey too.  These lagoons were our best chance and so Anh had his eyes on the hills as we paddled around.  Alas, no langurs or monkeys were to be found.
</p>

<p>
The first lagoon was ringed with high hills and was pretty.  At one corner it had a second, darker pass-through cave into another lagoon.  The pass through – “the tunnel of love” – had stalactites and a picture perfect opening into the inner lagoon.  We paddled around here for a little while, then went back through both caves and took a circuitous route back to the boat.  Along the way we saw a little green Kingfisher bird.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257953669">
<p>
We swam for a few minutes off the mother boat, and then at ~3:30pm took off for the one hour ride back to the camp.  The tide was a little low, so we paddled from the boat to the beach, instead of having the boat pull up to the sand.
</p>

<p>
We showered – Kat’s hair is a tangle since she went swimming – and settled onto the dinning area porch to write and watch the sky go dark.  It is overcast so there was not much sunset color to see.  This whole day clouds have been blowing across the sky, but none have opened up and rained.
</p>

<p>
Katrina ordered us Ha Long Bay cocktails, which are pea green, and we wrote in our journals.  Some new guests are arriving; we are up to 10 people in the huts.  
</p>

<p>
Anh sat with us and looked at a book of rare animals in Vietnam, including langurs, macaques, birds, snakes and insects.  We asked him a number of questions to learn about life in Vietnam.  In Vietnam 3,000 people die each year from snake bites!  80% of Vietnamese are still rural farmers, and even though the country had Chinaesque population controls it is still expected to be 100 million people large in 2015.  Most people here work 6 or 7 days a week.  A good office wage might be 5 million dong per month, or about $300/month.  Factories pay their workers a government specified minimum wage.  People here vote in community elections, but typically they just try to vote against the incumbent.  Corruption is still rampant in the government.  People are looking for honest leaders but they don’t have much faith in the current system’s ability to select honest people.  Anh himself just gives kayaking and mountain hiking tours in Northern Vietnam for Hanspan.  Northern Vietnam is much more mountainous than southern Vietnam.
</p>

<p>
Anh has never been out of the country.  Like Alvin and Nick, we are reminded that the world is not fair with regards to incomes and ease of travel.  To have tour guides that cannot afford to travel seems odd and cruel.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257965882">
<p>
At dinner we had some new foods.  There were French fries like last night and peanuts too, but we had bok choy and vegetable stuffed tofu, plus some pink and purple skinned fruit that had white flesh and a kiwi like consistency.  They also served eggs.
</p>

<p>
Oh, I got a confirmed mosquito bite this evening, and put on bug spray right away.
</p>

</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258008363">
<h3><a name="091112">11/12/09</a></h3>

<p>
Even with the mosquito netting, I still go a few bites in the night.  In the early morning we got some rain, which lasted up until the sunrise.  We also had some rodent scurrying around in the eaves, clattering on the bamboo supports and then burrowing in the thatched roof.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258011702">
<p>
We were up earlier than usual at 6:30am, and had breakfast of toast, eggs and banana, the same as always.  During breakfast we heard a macaque monkey calling from the trees about half way up the cliff.  It was smaller than I expected and solitary, and shook the trees a few times then hung out to be observed.  One of the other guests asked Katrina what we were looking at, she told him a macaque and he went back to the breakfast table and told everyone we were bird watching.  Oh well.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258018757">
<p>
We went kayaking at 8:30am.  The waves were bigger today in the open water, so we kept to the sheltered islands.  There were more fish jumping, and even a big splash from a sting ray.  We checked out a lagoon, and paddled up the fiord-like channel to the west of our camp.  I kept thinking of the New Zealand Fiordlands on these paddles.
We also passed a number of floating fisheries, where dogs always bark at us as we approach.  This is a security system of sorts.  One home had a little girl that waved to us.  We had been told that villages with more than 100 people get a school built for them.  However, schools cost money for all parents.  This means that country children don’t always attend school past the first few grades.  At another fishing plantation, the owner waved to us with a down-turned palm (imagine grasping the handlebars of a bike and then releasing them).  We did not understand this means “come here” in Vietnamese.  Anh says fishermen in farms outside of the village like company as they get lonely.  Perhaps we were being invited in for a drink.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258022010">
<p>
Within sight of our camp, Kat and I explored a small beach.  It had lots of shells and coral and Katrina made a collection to bring home.  I was most impressed with the craggy weathered rock and the greens of the water.

We were back to camp by 11:30am.  This morning we had already packed up our bags (Katrina had discovered that a rodent chewed through her bag’s side pocket and nibbled on a Boston souvenir  chocolate bar we had purchase at the airport) so we hung out until lunch at 12.  Lunch was sliced and fried potatoes, tofu with fresh tomatoes, egg, fried onion and cucumbers.  We ordered “B52” drinks, which tasted good but felt wrong for Americans to be drinking in Vietnam.  The boat back to Cat Ba arrived as we were still eating.  Anh suggested there was no rush and that we could wait until 1:30 to leave.  Katrina on the other hand hoped to buy postcards on Cat Ba, so we boarded at 1pm and left earlier.  The high-speed ferry was scheduled for 2:30pm.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258038578">
<p>
We got to Cat Ba Island at 1:30, and learned that because of rough seas the ferry was taking a longer route (2h45m) around the east and north of Cat Ba Island.  As such, we would be departing from the same small port where we had just arrived.  Alas, no postcards were being sold in the small port!  We ended up waiting until 4pm for the ferry to arrive, mostly just watching the locals pull up and unload goods.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258042336">
<p>
The long ferry rout went through the protected waters of Ha Long Bay, so we pasted some of the same islands from yesterday.  Unfortunately the windows of the boat were very hard to see though, so we had to stand up and peer through a sliding opening in the window.  The German woman in the row ahead of us would hand me her camera every so often so I could take pictures for her.  When there was a good view of the sunset, there was a rush of cameras over my head to take photos out of the small open window.  The last 30 minutes of travel was along the huge port in Hai Phong.  The windows made it hard to see, but we passed many large cranes, freighters, and tankers in the dark.
</p>

<p>
A Handspan bus met us and another tour of four people at the port, and then we did the 2.5 hour drive to our hotel.  I was most puzzled by the stream of Hyundai Santa Fe SUVs that kept passing us; all had the look of just being unloaded or manufactured since they still had on protective wrap.  They also had on temporary plates.  There was a huge flow of truck traffic at this time, and in some location guys with flashlights would wave the trucks over to the side of the road.  The guys did not look official – perhaps they were associated with truck stops?  In one of the midway cities, I spotted some people climbing over the highway center barrier to cross the highway.  The truckers were honking at these people, attempting to discourage them.
</p>

<p>
Watching the bus driver maneuver through the moped traffic was like watching someone walk across an ant-covered floor without squashing any.  Lots of slow deliberate movements (and honking and flashing) was needed.  Never the less, we have not seen any traffic accidents here in Vietnam.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258060120">
<p>
We tipped Anh 500,000 dong and checked into the Hotel Elegance.  For dinner we crossed the street to Tamarind vegetarian restaurant.  Like the hotel, all of the prices were in US Dollars.  We were among the other foreign tourists eating – no locals were there.  We tried the filled sesame falafel (eh), spring rolls (better, but Katrina’s have better Thai basil and sauce), pho (good, but nothing like Le’s pho from home, though the fresh noodles were nice) and green curry (also good).  None of the dishes were a knockout, and they all seemed like reinterpretations of traditional dishes.
</p>

<p>
After dinner we washed clothes, took showers and finally cleaned away the stink of kayaking and of the kayak itself.  What a relief!
</p>

<p>
We got up with the sun at 6am so that we would have the time to walk around Hanoi.  We ate at the hotel’s dining room, and the food was rather good!  I had lemonade, pineapple crepe, croissant and some fruit.  As Anh said, the Vietnamese “have the technology” from France and can do good baked goods and crepes.
</p>

<p>
We started our walk by going south towards a city park/lake.  Along the way we bought postcards and walked through a street market of meat, fish and vegetables.  There were also bags of spices and candy being sold.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258097995">
<p>
The lake was very green and surrounded by a ring road.  Even at 7am, there was a thick flow of mopeds making and American style crossing impossible.  “Aha!” we though when we spotted a pedestrian crossing with a stoplight.  Pressing the button we watched the light turn to red, and then laughed out loud as not one of the following 40 mopeds stopped for the light!  The only thing to do was to play Moses and walk across the see of bikes, hoping that by miracle (or local traffic tradition) the bikes would part around us.  And indeed they did.  We made it across four lanes of traffic without dying.  Next time maybe we would cross reading a book as Anh had suggested.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258098160">
<p>
Around the lake were Hanoians getting their chi moving by waving arms and stomping feet.  We walked back north on a street parallel to our hotel’s to see some of old Hanoi.  Along the way we stopped at and HSBC bank branch so that I could take out money to make Sam, Rose and Louis millionaires (in dong).   The ATM only gave out 500,000 dong notes, so we went inside to see if I could exchange them for 1,000,000 dong notes.  Then disappointment: there is no 1,000,000 dong note!  (If this is true, then the largest note here is worth ~$30.)  I wanted to redeposit the cash when I heard I had been foiled, but that too cannot be done as our accounts are not Vietnamese accounts.  So the new plan is to frame the two 500,000 dong notes such that front and back can be seen.  Boy, I feel silly!
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258098893">
<p>
We walked through some of the busy old streets.  Various streets have different focuses; toys, shoes, memorial plaques, office supplies, or tourist gifts.  We stopped at a bakery and got chocolate croissants to test the technology again – it passed the test with flying colors.  We also peeked into an indoor market and found a small watercolor painting for 90,000 dong that I bought – it shows Ha Long.
</p>

<p>
A lot of shop business in Hanoi is done on the sidewalks, forcing you to walk in the street.  Most notable are the little pho restaurants with their short plastic chairs that serve noodle soup by the bowl.  Ladies also walk around with twin-basket yolks, selling food, fruits and vegetables.  Some vendors load up bicycles with flower and vend them in the streets.  Most established shops only use the first floor and move merchandise out onto the sidewalk.  Only a few stores have much space inside to walk about.
</p>

<p>
Also curious to me in Hanoi are the tangles of phone and power wires that spread likes nets over the streets.  These are so dense and thick that I doubt they have ever been renovated in the history of the power line.
</p>

<p>
The buildings in old town are very thin, two to four story structures.  Some of the upper floors are so dilapidated that they might not be used at all.  Most are painted warm yellows, oranges and peaches, and have French colonial architecture.  (The French are also responsible for moving Vietnam from Chinese characters to Latin script.)
</p>

<p>
Last night I noticed that many of the white-shirt factory girls wear their hair in long ponytails that go all the way down to their mid-backs.  Today I was also noticing the women wearing pajamas in the street; perhaps I misinterpret the clothes?  In official settings, the female staff wear the long shirts (dresses?) with long openings along their pant covered legs.  I associate this outfit with here and Thailand too, and it is rather attractive.  In the clothing stores there are many brash colors, leopard and tiger prints, and garments bearing designer names (presumably faked).
</p>

<p>
Hanoi city was quickly overwhelming for me, mostly form the continuous assault by mopeds and horns.  At least the local vendors are not as aggressive as those from Guanxi – only the bicycle cabbies approach us here, as well as random guys on mopeds asking if we need transport.
</p>

<p>
Since we had extra time, we doubled back all the way to the lake and Katrina found a bookstore.  I looked at a how-to-draw-anime book, continually impressed by the strange fetish culture of the Japanese.  I wonder if Michael Konkol can draw like that.
</p>

<p>
We went back to the hotel to send out postcards (Ruta only got Kat’s Japan postcard yesterday!) and wash our boots before the flight to Kuala Lumpur and Auckland.  I god the dirt from our hikes off and also removed the soot from Hanoi.  Hanoi is much more breathable thank Beijing, but it still has a soot/ash covering on the pavements, cars and steps.  Our hotel has a white doormat in front that is covered in black footprints.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258110317">
<p>
We used our last dong in combination with $5 USD to pay for the airport taxi.  An aggressive 45 minute ride later we arrived.  Along the way I noticed many traffic cops, some in green uniform, others in blue or khaki, standing along the roads and highways with batons for flagging down traffic.  Unlike in Russia where the cops are constantly stopping people and looking for infractions, the Vietnamese police mostly stay out of the way.  (Russia has the most in-your-face police state I have experienced.)
</p>

<p>
We checked in and wandered around the departure lounge for awhile, looking at gifts.  I noticed the duty-free Baileys cost $20 USD for a 1L bottle.  Katrina wanted to by a pants+dress combination outfit but found it just felt silly when she put it on.
</p>

<p>
We ate lunch in the airport – fried rice and yellow noodles with veggies – and boarded the Kuala Lumpur flight 15 minutes late for a 2:25pm departure.  Our flight was a little more than three hours on a 737 with Fruit Loop colored seats.  Most impressive is the floral dresses worn by the female crew and the slick aquamarine suits and pointy jelled hair of the male crew.  The food however was mushy and unappetizing.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258134294">
<p>
We hoped to see the record high Petronas skyscrapers when landing in Kuala Lumpur, but only rows and rows of palm tree forest was visible.  The airport is very large, clean and modern, with tall wood paneled ceilings and marble floors.  Looking down the concourse in the C terminal, the lights in the ceiling look like stars.  We wandered around, looking for gadu-gadu and were surprised to find a Harrod’s instead.  It turns out this was a British colony.  We at samosas and a banana leaf rice dish at one of the airport ‘clubs’, priced a Bailey’s 1L bottle (74 RMB or $22.77 USD) and looked into the gift shops and bookstore in the mall-like terminal hub.  This airport is as modern as Hong Kong’s but nowhere near as busy.  In fact, I have only seen two jets here that are not from Malaysian Airlines.
</p>

<p>
Another difference here is the amount of headscarfs seen.  More than half of the waitresses wear them.  Also, the features and coloring of the people here is completely foreign to me – some of the men here I would have had no chance of identifying them as Malaysian.  I might have guessed Indian instead.  Katrina says that there are ethnic peoples form India, China and native Malaysians all living in the country.
</p>

<p>
Our flight to Auckland was on a 777 – this may have been only the second or third 777 I have flown.  The total flight time was ~10 hours, flying over Indonesia and a large chunk of Australia too.  Not that we saw any of this since our flight left at 9:30pm Kuala Lumpur time (2:30apm New Zealand time?) and did not land until 12:30pm New Zealand time.  Also, Kat and I had seats in the middle of the plane.
</p>

<p>
We got to choose our movies and watched the Time Traveler’s Wife during dinner.  The movie stayed fairly true to the book and was good to watch.  I tried to sleep until the breakfast meal – I had the seat leaned back with the wings on the headrest folded up cradling my head, earplugs in and a blanket over my head to block out the light.  This setup mostly worked.

New Zealand
</p>

<p>
On the plane we filled out declaration forms for New Zealand, freely admitting all of our hiking, tea, wood carvings and bamboo art.  In the baggage claim area officers with a beagle were inspecting bags for fruit.  When the beagle found fruit he got a doggie treat.  This dog thought my day pack had fruit too though I don’t think it has carried fruit recently…did I carry bananas in it?  Oh well, whatever.  Customs also checked the wood and bamboo pieces in our bags and the tread of our hiking boots, and then sent us on our way.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258197504">
<p>
Fully in NZ (and stinking of travel again) picked up our rent-a-wreck from Jucy Rentals (NZ $190), we got some NZ cash at the airport (NZ $1 = $0.76 USD), and started following our Google Maps directions to our Auckland hostel, “The Brown Kiwi”, in Ponsonby.  Our directions mislabeled the exit off of Hwy 1, so we ended up accidentally leaving Auckland over the harbor bridge.  We recovered, turned around and found our hostel relatively easily there after.
</p>

<p>
The hostel keeper is friendly, welcomed us and checked us into the second floor room in the garden “granny unit”.  The main house of the hostel has a kitchen, recreation room and bathrooms on the first floor, a suburban sized garden with sitting patio, a shed with laundry services and then the granny unit.  I think maybe there are six other guests, none American that I can tell.
</p>

<p>
It was almost 4pm and I was hungry, so we walked down Ponsonby Road looking for an Italian restaurant from the guide book.  This road is upscale with clothes shopping, dining and lounges.  Good looking 20-somethings (and older) were hanging out at the cafes and bars.  It is not Boston Newbury Street upscale, but it is nice.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258219012">
<p>
The target restaurant no longer exists, so we ate at a (lousy) no name taqueria.  Are we too far from Mexico for good Mexican food?  We then took the Link bus to downtown and walked along the water and along the base of the towers.  (Oh, on the bus ride we passed a park with two cricket games going on.)  The most exciting thing here was that I saw my first Evo IX wagon!  There are actually lots of Evos and Subaru STIs, Imprezas, Legacys, and Foresters on Auckland’s roads.  None of these are the most current Evo Xs and STIs, but there is certainly a rally car following.  Other popular cars are the Monaro and Commador sedans, which are as plentiful as Accords and Camrys are in the US.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258219499">
<p>
In downtown we checked out the harbor, with its green, green waters.  The marina has a strange Batman-like boat in it.  We bought a GSM sim card from the 2-degrees NZ cellular network.  If I can unlock my US phone, I will get 49 cents/minute calling.  The sim card was only NZ $2.  We also got very complete north and south island road maps for NZ $60, which should give us the names of even the smallest roads.
</p>

<p>
Downtown Auckland reminded me of Halifax, but with a less interesting restaurant scene.  What was interesting was the mixture of white (English looking), Asian and Islander peoples about.  We heard Chinese and Japanese being spoken by young people and many of the restaurants are Asian too.
</p>

<p>
At about 6pm we reboarded the Link bus to complete its Auckland city loop.  We went through two or three other trendy neighborhoods, including one with a counterculture bent, before returning to Ponsonby.  From the top of some of the hills on the loop, you can see neighborhoods stretching far off into the metro area, a la San Francisco.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258226556">
<p>
We got breakfast cereal supplies, then were back at the hostel by 7:30pm.  The sun was just getting low at that hour.  After removing the ants from my toiletry bag, we showered and went to sleep.  Katrina has a headache from not getting enough rest on the plane that she hopes to sleep off.
</p>

<p>
It is raining lightly tonight.  The weather here reminds me of San Francisco with its fog-like drizzle and coolness.

<p>
This morning I awoke exhausted from the jetlag time zone changing.  We ate breakfast of kiwi, banana, muesli and milk in the hostel kitchen (this hostels is ~NZ $60 per night) and then packed our bags.  We went on the internet to send “still-alive” emails, and also unlocked my phone at the same time.  I know have a NZ sim card and NZ $2 of calling time!
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258279012">
<p>
From Auckland we headed north, over their bay bridge.  We then got off Hwy 1 and went to Davenport to take some across the bay photos of Auckland.  The angles were not as pretty as the view from the bridge itself, but oh well.  Davenport is pretty upscale, maybe the Sausalito of Auckland, but not quite that nice.  We did pass a Ferrari though.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258282145">
<p>
I drove the multilane portion of Hwy 1 until Orewa, at which point Katrina hopped in the driver’s seat and continued until Oakura Bay.  This southern part of our Hwy 1 journey looked too similar to CA for my satisfaction – I guess if something looks so similar I would rather be close to my family and driving on the right side of the road!  The land here is mostly pastoral, with sheep and cows and is mainly low rolling hills and mountains of grass.  When there is forest, it is an interesting mix of prehistoric-looking palm trees – 10’ tall with very dark trunks – and conifers.  One of the conifers here looks like the artificial Christmas trees you can buy in the states.  There must be 3’ or clearance between each layer of branches.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258290988">
<p>
Once off of Hwy 1N and onto the Russell Rd (to “Romantic Russell”) the road got smaller and still twistier.  Off the left side of the road was a picturesque stream running in a deep gully.  The gully was covered by trees – very pretty!  We passed mostly farms – called “stations” in local speak – until we hit the coast.  I had Kat turn off Russell Road and head to a Park Scenic Reserve peninsula, but she got uncomfortable when the road turned to dirt (and when we were already at 2pm and had not yet eaten lunch!).  So we did not make it to the coast just then.  I took over driving and started enjoying the flow of the road to Russell.  We passed a number of nice, green-watered bays.  We started seeing more gated houses and resort-sounding lodges too.  Yachts were appearing in the bays.
</p>

<p>
We also were noticing the birds along the way.  My favorite is a bird about the size of a rugby ball on legs which has a black body and a dark blue breast.  It has long legs and is more likely to walk away than run, so I have been calling it the Walka-walka bird.  We have since discovered that it is a Pukeko.  There are also black and white birds, and some birds of prey to be seen.  The seagulls here are smaller and have redder beaks and feet than the American ones.
</p>

<p>
Oh, the cows here seem to be in breeding mode.  All the females are locked into a tight field and their butts are chalked blue so the farmer can tell which ones have been mounted by the bull.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258297577">
<p>
In Russell we walked down the two main streets looking for some food.  We ended up getting a small pizza for lunch and the making of tortilla chip salad from the market for dinner.  We also purchased breakfast food for tomorrow, forgetting that breakfast is included in our new hostel!
</p>

<p>
Russell is a quiet little tourist town with great bay views (the tropical colored waters are what set this area apart from CA).  The beach here is made of small rocks rather than sand.  There is a marina too, where we booked a half-day boat tour (NZ $90 each) for tomorrow morning.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258301960">
<p>
Most people use the car ferry to get to Paihia from Russel.  However, when I learned there is a dirt road around the bay that locals use, I took it as a challenge.  We thus took the local route to the other side of the bay.  The dirt portion is maybe 20km long and is well groomed with well banked twisties through the hills and along the wetlands.  It is quite pretty and also a fun driving experience for me.  I would like to be confident enough to really attack such a road, but even at what I thought was 6/10’s speed I still almost understeered of the road at few tight turns with loose gravel.  I don’t think Kat realized these were understeer and not just me miscalculating the left side of the car.  Anyway, it was fun and would love to try it with AWD and with getting the car loose.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258303772">
<p>
We traveled past another nice tidal stream before arriving in Paihia.  We went straight to our hostel, the Pickled Parrot, and checked in.  We were given the room “Morepork.”  There is an actual parrot ‘Rocky’ here, and he was busy imitating the cat’s meow and the telephone’s ring this afternoon.  While we were eating our home cooked tortilla chip salads, he was hanging out under the table and poking my leg.  Apparently, he cannot eat chocolate or avocado.
</p>

<p>
We washed all of our clothes tonight, so I am writing in my bathing suit and rain jacket.  In this same outfit we took a twilight walk down by the Paihia waterfront.  At 8:30pm there was still a little light in the sky.  From the few blocks we walked Paihia seems much more touristy than Russell.  Almost every establishment we passed was a hotel or eatery.  There are also many hotels advertizing to backpackers.
</p>

<p>
So far NZ has been pretty expensive.  We have spent NZ $60 on hostels, $60 on food, and $180 on trips today.  We still have the daily car and gas costs too!  Entrees at the local restaurants are all in the NZ $20-$30 range.  We will try cooking for ourselves to save pennies!

Bay of Islands
</p>

<p>
This morning we got up earlier so we could make our 9am Discover NZ Bay of Islands boat tour.  We ate breakfast of cereals (Wheat Bix are pretty gross and pasty!) and toast at the hostel.  We headed down to the pier a little early and noticed that there was a cruise ship in the bay.  Our pictures confirm it is the same boat that was in Auckland yesterday.  Because of the ship, there was a small crafts fair across from the port.  We looked at a few “green rock” pendants, but there are so expensive in the NZ $50-$120 range.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258360511">
<p>
We were some of the first on the yellow Discovery boat, and sat up on the roof deck as far forward as possible.  The boat went from Paihia to Russel to pick up the rest of the tourists, before starting the tour.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, today was overcast so the bay was more grey-green than light green.  In the shallower locations we did see some nice emerald waters.
</p>

<p>
Again, the shapes of the hills on the bay could be from coastal Northern California.  However, the rich green grasses and trees suggest a different location, maybe Hawaii for the exoticness of the foliage.  The waters are also colored more appropriately for Hawaii too.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258363562">
<p>
We started out by looking at a view of the larger islands.  An island in this bay is defined as land with foliage that is completely surrounded by water.  There are more than 140 islands in the bay.  We saw one completely private island where the owner has reintroduced the native foliage and kiwi birds.  Another island was part private, part public and a third was a park island where you could camp.  All beaches in NZ are public properties, so even on the private island you could pull up and play on the beach all day, as long as you leave by sundown.  The bay is rather pretty with nice surrounding hills and beachy, cliffy islands.  The rich grasses make me think of Ireland too (though I have never been to Ireland!).  Historically, this bay was one of the first found by Captain Cook, and was then one of the first seaports in NZ.  Russell was known as a hell hole for all of the bars and brothels it contained.  The islands in the bay were cattle ranched since they were easily contained spaces and no fences were needed.  Farmers would torch the whole island, and then move in herds to feed on the grasses that grew out of the ashes.  At some point mainland farming became more profitable and the island farms were abandoned.  The lucky families today are those whose farmer ancestors left the island land in a trust for the family.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258365031">
<p>
We next encountered dolphins in the bay.  There are many here, over 50, and they were coming up to the boats, checking us out, jumping and splashing.  This was the most fun part of the whole trip.  I saw a pair of parents with a baby.  I missed the copulating pair of dolphins, but learned they copulate often and that the female keeps the multiple sessions of sperm inside her and can decide which sperm to release to the egg.  NZ is one of the few places where the dolphin population is growing.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258366161">
<p>
We left the bay and went into the rougher seas towards “Hole in the Rock.”  The 20 minutes there and back go to Kat and she was not happy.  Hole in the Rock is a tunnel in an island.  The tunnel is large enough for our boat to pass through, which it did.  Nearby were also a historic lighthouse and a channel where ocean fish are concentrated and to which the birds flock.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258369723">
<p>
Next, we returned to the bay and stopped at the park island for 50 minutes.  We walked about Urupukapuka Island and checked out a few viewpoints.  The grasses are very thick and green right now, and there are some nice scented flowers on the bushes.  
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258373757">
<p>
On the boat we talked a little with an English couple.  The wife was a travel agent and she was from Cambridge too!  Among other places, she highly recommended the Seychelles but admitted it is very expensive. 
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258376411">
<p>
After the boat ride we made avocado, cheese and tomato sandwiches at the hostel, then drove to the nearby Waitangi Treaty Ground.  This is the location where the British and Maori chiefs signed a treaty making the Maori British citizens with full rights.  This treaty essentially created New Zealand in 1835.
</p>

<p>
The grounds are on the Bay of Islands, looking at Russell, and contain the British official’s house, a Maori Waka war canoe (35 meters long made from 3 thick trees) and a beautifully made, wood-carved Maori meeting house.  Most of the carvings in this house had Maori faces with tongues sticking out.  The carvings were also not shy about showing genitalia.
</p>

<p>
On the grounds we also saw a black bird with a dark blue tail that has two white sacks under its chin.  This bird’s distinctive and intricate call can be heard through the woods.  Later in the day, Katrina saw a parrot-like bird by the road, and then a miniature stoat-like mammal along the road too.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258384810">
<p>
We took at two hour hike down the Haruru Falls Track to a mangrove boardwalk.  I was not interested in the track, which ran in the woods along a golf course, until the mangrove point.  Here we followed the boardwalk over the mudflat left by the low tide.  The mud had pockmarks from the many crabs and shrimp in the mud.   Snapping shrimp make the forest crackle.  The mud was also broached by mangrove roots popping out of the ground in quest for air.  There were so many breathing roots that it looked like a muddy lawn under the trees.  Very cool.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258391040">
<p>
After the hike we drove to the Haruru Falls to see what we could have seen if we hiked the whole trail (eh).  We then continued on to Karikari. Karikari has many fruit orchards and vineyards.  Since we arrived after 5pm, most of these had shut for the day.  We sneaked in just in time to the chocolate factory Makana and tasted their excellent brittle and also their orange cream truffles.  We drove down main street (mostly closed) and down to the historic sites of the first stone and first wood houses in NZ.  These are next to a pretty river.  Finally, we went to New World supermarket to buy food for dinner.  I drove back to Paihia and filled up the car for NZ $51 @ $1.68/liter!

Dinner was boxed ravioli and sauce with a side of asparagus.  We had a Karikari vineyards Rose which was bubbly and not well liked.  We finished with fruit salad – kiwi, banana, apple, pineapple, orange – and rice crackers mix.  Dinner cost ~NZ $25.  I am still getting used to the local prices!

<p>
This morning we slept in a little later – to 8:30am – then ate breakfast of leftover fruit salad, yogurt and cereal with toast.  We had packed and checked out by 9:45.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258453937">
<p>
Today we were driving back to Auckland.  We decided on a long west-coast route to see some new places.  From Paihia we took two-lane highways due west, crossing the island in about 1h 30m.  Katrina drove and we passed many cattle and sheep ranches, going over and around green pasture grass hills.  Some of the sheep were sheared, but most still had their wool.  I like the way fluffy sheep look; they remind me of Orchard Hill from my childhood.  There were also a number of farms with strong, proud, well-groomed horses.  As some big Thanksgiving size turkeys in a field that I think were feral, but Katrina thinks were domesticated.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258456020">
<p>
Close to the west coast we drove around a range of coastal mountains and into Opononi, where a bay splits the coast.  To the north of the inlet is a very significant mountain or sand, all tracked up by sand boarding and vehicles.  The mountains on the other sides of the bay are green from grass and trees.  Katrina got tea in Opononi, and then we went to a lookout park on the south side of the inlet.  We stood on some sandstone outcroppings and watched the big strong waves break out at sea and then pound the coast.  There was very little beach at the bottom of our hill, so we did not go down.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258460699">
<p>
Instead, we drove a few km south, and tried to access the beach by another road.  This road quickly turned to dirt, then squiggled along a pastoral valley with cows, next to a muddy river running to the sea.  However, the road did not make it to the beach, but rather stopped at the riverside.  We saw one local in an older Nissan sedan drive down into the river, forge along the river’s edge for 20’ and then climb back up the steep bank to his trailer home.  What a driveway!
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258461902">
<p>
Back on the North/South coastal highway, we went south to see the kauri trees in Waipoura Kauri Forest.  We stopped first to see New Zealand’s biggest Kauri tree, a tree which is estimated to be 2,000 years old and maybe 20 or 30 feet thick.  The tree is not as tall as a sequoia, but just as thick.  Its trunk is straight and regularly round for the first 40 feet or so, and then huge branches appear rising skyward.  The tree itself houses 30 other organisms!  Just like the fern/palm trees that are so common in NZ, this tree feels like it is from a different time.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258463525">
<p>
We got back in the car and travelled 5 more minutes south to another stand of trees.  Here was a large surviving swath of old growth forest.  We paid a parking attendant NZ $2 to look for car thieves, then walked 20 minutes into the forest to NZ’s second largest kauri.  It was just as formidable as the first.  What was more interesting was the lush, cool and moist jungle.  The size of the ferns and particularly the grasses is huge and makes you feel like you are in “Honey I Shrunk the Kids.”  The grasses must have been 7’ tall!  There were also delicate mosses in the forest floor that looked very wet and really pretty.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258465324">
<p>
We walked back past the Four Sisters (Siamese twins these) kauri tree and then got back in the car.  The 15km of forest highway was soon over (I was driving the twisties here) and we got back into more gorgeous mountain/valley pasture lands.  I feel guilty for enjoying the pasture greenery as much as the unique, prehistoric old growth kauri forest, for I know the valuable old growth was killed to make the grazing land.  (In those places where new forest is growing back, the new forest seems so dry in comparison to the old growth!)
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258469228">
<p>
In Omamare (maybe 30 minutes south of the forest) we turned west to the coast again, trying to find the beach.  In our guide, the beach was draw with a 4wd road icon, and we thought perhaps we could drive the beach all the way to Dargaville.  Again, in the small beach community, a river flowing to the sea blocked beach access. If we had a truck (or the balls of the local from the first river) we could have crossed the shallow water to the beach on the other side.  However, we probably would have had to ford many other rivers to the sea on the beach highway, so turning around was the best choice.  We continued south on a dirt road from Omamare that was marked at 100kmh!  I did 40kmh most of the way, not wanting to destroy the car’s paint.  If I lived in NZ, I would get big mud flaps, dirt road tires and a roll cage for my Evo so I could do 100kmh on these fantastic dirt roads.  This particular road followed a ridge from which glimpses of the ocean could be seen over cattle grazing land.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258472943">
<p>
The road reconnected with the paved highway, and we zoomed down to Dargaville for a very late lunch at “Blah, Blah, Blah” café.  We both had lentil burgers on focaccia with chutney relish.  Another patron complemented my Ferrari hat, then told me how is Ferrari hat had faded pink too, and he would put it on with his pink skirt, go over to his buddy’s and have a laugh.  Was I just called a queer?
</p>

<p>
We went south via Ruawai and then back to Hwy 1.  This stretch was largely flat and agricultural, and not so interesting.  The only curious part was that there were many kaurma farms producing their sweet potato like veggie.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258486123">
<p>
Our only Hwy 1 stop was at McDonalds to pee and have a snack of fries.  (We had to ask for catsup!)  We got back to Auckland/Ponsonby by 6:30pm and rechecked in to the Brown Kiwi.  For dinner we ate at a cheap, fantastic and spicy Thai Me Up restaurant on Ponsonby Rd.  We both got red curry.  The place was full of 20-something girls enjoying the food.  The meal was less than NZ $30, which is a steal here.
</p>

<p>
We returned to the hostel to clean up and get some sleep before tomorrow’s flight to Queenstown.

Queenstown
</p>

<p>
This morning it was raining as we packed, drove to the airport (got a little lost at first then got stuck in 20 minutes of extra traffic), fueled the car, dropped off the car and then shuttled to the airport.  We tried to use the Jetstar self check in machines but the one we got had an error and did not print Kat’s bag tag.  We checked in again at the regular counter.  At security, they discovered I had my Swiss Army knife in my bag.  They opened it, took a look at the blade and said no problem, the blade is small and non-locking so I can take it on board.  Never in the US would I have been able to keep the knife.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258544763">
<p>
The flight left at 11:10 am, so we checked internet while waiting.  It was still raining when we took off, but by the time we were over the south island the clouds were clearing.  At first I was disappointed because the mountains I was seeing looking out the window in the NW section of the island were not that tall, did not have snow and there were plenty of settlements and farms in the valleys.  10 minutes south and that all changed as we hit the NZ Alps.  These run in a very thick band south along the coast and are tall and snowcapped.  They steeply plunge into a maze of valleys.  The valleys themselves seem rather flat with a buildup of sediment.  Neither the hills nor valleys are green – just rock gray/brown.
</p>

<p>
We saw some of the notable high peaks in Mt Aspiring and Mt Cook, and we may have seen the Mitre Peak of Milford Sound far off in the distance.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258547895">
<p>
To land amongst theses high ranges, the pilot took the plane down over the big valley that contains Queenstown, then did a 360 turn while descending to buy more time to lose altitude!  The valley stopped looking so flat as we got closer, and we could see a river running through it with sandy washes and green clear waters.  Two miles away from the runway the plane made a quick right turn to line up for landing.  The pilot slammed on the brakes and reverse thrusters after landing since the runway is mighty short for an Airbus A320.  We made it fine but he used the full length.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258551522">
<p>
Outside, the air was cool (55 or 60 degrees) and sunny, very dry and mountain fresh.  We took Super Shuttle to the Pinewoods lodge – our driver was playing tour guide, as well as telling jokes at the expense of Australia.  Our room at the lodge is a college style apartment.  Four rooms share a common bath, kitchen and living room.  The setup is generous and comfortable, if not luxurious.  From our windows we do have a mountain view and even saw paragliders coming down from the gondola station.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258555329">
<p>
We walked into town around 2:30pm, got NZ interpretation falafel at Hebebe’s and ate them (messily) by the Lake Wakatipu.  The waters here are deep blue and see-through by the rocky shore (not a steep shore, just one containing weathered rocks) and surrounded by mountains on all sides.  We say both historic steamers and modern excitements 360 degree spin jet boats heading out onto the lake.  We walked along the shoreline of Queenstown Gardens to take in the lake views, made jokes about the extreme activities to do here (extreme photography!), checked out Double Cone Mountain (one is bigger than the other, but almost no one notices).  We then explored the downtown streets, all seem new and fresh and spruced up for tourists.  Plenty of tour operators of extreme activities, sports stores, and eateries line the streets.  We tried the local gelato shop (good!) and also looked in a wool shop that had clothes of wool and possum fur!  We checked out the house prices (they are not that outrageous) and finally at 4:30pm reported to Ultimate Hikes for our briefing.
</p>

<p>
The hike introduction told us about the two days of travel surrounding the three days of 10 mile hikes.  They went over the packing list and told us to prepare for anything – just this week one group got snow on their summit day.  Most other groups are getting grain and likely we will too.  It turns out that Kat’s silk thermal pants are no good in the rain, so after the briefing we went shopping.  Kat got new thermals (once we found some cheaper than NZ $100!) and we both found some rain covers for our packs.  We hit up the local Fresh Choice supermarket for canned soup and spinach salad makings.   We forgot salad dressing, so I had to go back to pick some up.  Paul Newman’s was almost the only olive oil based dressing.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258570279">
<p>
We showered and packed for the trip after dinner.  I am multi plastic bagging everything in an attempt to keep it dry; I hope I succeed!

Milford Hike Day 1
</p>

<p>
We got up much earlier than our 7:45am alarm because the sun comes up so early here.  The sun may have appeared around 6am, after not getting dark until 9pm!  We ate breakfast of muesli, kiwi and yogurt, finished packing our hiking base (as lightly as we dared) and then headed to check out.  At reception we left duffels without extra stuff – gifts, spare clothes, etc.  We were in town by 8:30am, one hour before our Milford bus was to leave.  We spent half an hour looking for tea at various coffee shops.  McCafe had the cheapest, so Kat purchased it there, but they put in the milk too soon so the tea never steeped.
</p>

<p>
At about 9am we went to the Ultimate Hikes office.  I rented a walking pole to help protect my left knee from the hike.  We checked in and got our name tags.  Here we met two of our four guides – Megan (NZ) and Matasuko (Japan).  
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258623372">
<p>
For the bus ride to Te Anu, we sat upfront but on the left side of the bus.  It turns out the best views were on the right side, looking over Queenstown’s lake at the mountains.  We’ll have to switch sides on the way back.  After leaving the Queenstown area, we travelled through a broad dry valley with mountains on each side, none showing snow.  There were many sheep, cattle and deer farms (oddly!) along the way and also a wind farm in the distance to the south.  In general this dry valley reminded me of Sun Valley Idaho for the scrub and the shape of the mountains.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258628622">
<p>
We turned west and took a short stop in Mossburn for toilets and banana chocolate chip ice cream (OK).  Then we continued northwest to Te Anu with the snowcapped mountains starting to appear and grow closer in the distance.  We pasted two areas of preserved native land, a change from the grass pastures and yellow flowers of Scottish brush/broom.  One native land was clumps 4’ square of golden prairie grass called red tussock.  The second area may have been bushes and trees.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258632138">
<p>
We ate lunch at a hotel in Te Anu.  Small veggie sandwiches had been prepared for me and Kat.  One fellow walker at our table was Peter, a retired Debbie-Downer from Australia.  Another was Larry from Portsmouth, NH – I ended up talking with him for a bit.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258634529">
<p>
We reboarded the bus and drive 15 miles north along the Te Anu lake to our boat.  The lake is 400 meters deep, and its bottom is actually below sea level.  There were stiff westerly winds and menacing clouds overhead, so the lake surface was dark.  Across the lake began the mountains of the Fiordlands, tall and snowcapped.
</p>

<p>
I rode upstairs on the boat’s roof for most of the trip.  The winds threatened to take off my hat and chilled me too, but the scenery was worth it.  We could loop up a few fiords extending west as we travelled to the northern tip of the lake.  The wind was strong enough at times that I could lean into it and be held up.  Also, on the boat were the unguided walkers – their packs were much larger than ours, as they needed to pack in food and cook gear.  At about 3:30pm we landed with tall mountains all around and the lake threading its way through.  We disinfected our boots on the dock, took family photos at the Start of the Milford Track sign and then started the 20 minute walk to Glade House.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258643578">
<p>
This 1 mile walk is through original old forest that does not periodically burn.  There are no thick Kauri trees here, but the old trees are covered in mosses.  Everything is covered in thick draping mosses.  This is the “goblin” forest.  We were greeted by a fantail bird, which fluttered around us.  The birds here are not used to predators, so they come close and are curious.  New Zealand had no mammals, no bees, butterflies or moths.  For this reason the birds are not shy and colorful flowers/orchids are not as common.  There was a super big Moa bird (3 meters tall) that is now extinct.  It used to eat blade ferns so the plan now grows sharp leaves for the first 3m of its life, then normal leaves up top after the 3m mark.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258644408">
<p>
The walk to the lodge was quite quick, and we got assigned to a shared bunk (#3) with six beds.  The camp is very comfy, with a heated room for clothes drying, clean warm bathrooms, and a bar.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258647649">
<p>
After the group photo, we took a nature walk. Kelley (NZ) was our guide.  Some of what he told us I have already written, but he also showed us a peppertree, a stinky tree, and a flowerless orchid.  He explained how the soils are thin and the trees spread their roots along the surface, creating a web of roots.  One tree falling can thus topple others, creating tree avalanches.  Additionally, it rains a lot here and a 3-week dry spell is a drought.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258650358">
<p>
At the top of the hike we drank from a stream, and looked back at the lake.
</p>

<p>
At dinner we ate with Shaun (NZ/NYC), Sarah (NYC), Michelle (Aust), and Donna O (CA).  Donna is employed by Hollywood, works on the Lord of the Rings team doing graphics work.  Dinner itself was pasta, Kat and I hope we get some variety of food.  Shaun was the talker of the group.
</p>

<p>
We had an orientation after dinner, showing the upcoming route.  Travis (NZ), one of the guides, also demonstrated how to wear your pack (upside down, so that it hangs down below your butt) and how to get into your pack (lay it down on the floor, then do a forward-roll over it to collect it).
</p>

<p>
At 10pm the lights went out in the bunkroom.  We shared this bunkroom with Stephan and Inna (Germany), Ian and Sarah.

Milford Hike Day 2
</p>

<p>
We heard rain though out the night, but it had stopped by the time we got up (6:30am).  Lights came on at 6:45am – it was already light outside – and at about 7 we all went into the dining room to make our packed lunches.  We made two egg salad sandwiches each, took several pieces of fruit, candy bars and trail mix.  Breakfast started at 8am (we had lots of dead time in between) and it was porridge, followed by poached eggs, hash browns and fried tomatoes.  Katrina tried out Vegemite while being encouraged by Australians Michelle and Jenny – it was salty and tasted a bit like Braggs amino spray.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258705984">
<p>
At about 8:30am we headed back to the room and put on our packs.  I also had on a thermal top and bottoms, a t-shirt, long-sleeved shirt, and sweater, then my rain jacket and hat.  This was on account of getting cold at breakfast and then watching a misting rain start falling.
</p>

<p>
The rain and cloud cover would continue until 1:30pm lunch.  The clouds were high enough to let you see some of the mid level peaks along the valley.  We were hiking on the left side of the stream/river, in more of the mossy, mossy forest.  Sometimes looking across the river over the greenery we could see snow on the tops of the opposing valley side, and waterfalls cascading down their sides.  The best part of this first few miles were the old trees reaching over the water, stretching out, thick branches bending at sharp angles, dripping in moss.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258707724">
<p>
One of the first side stops was at the big old red beech tree.  The next was at a bog, with a view that looked up an adjacent valley with waterfalls and snow caps all around.  On the bog floor were many mosses, some light green, some dark green, some red and carnivorous.  All of the floor moss was very fine, no moss ‘leaf’ as broad as 1 or 2 cm.  There was also fine white moss leafing off the floor and small mushrooms too.  This bog actually lets water back into the environment when a dry spell hits.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258710339">
<p>
We continued along the riverside, passing some broad river stretches, some light/rocky rapids and some stone washes.  At the Clinton Hut – the 1st camp for do-it-yourself hikers, Katrina and I stripped off all long sleeve upper layers.  I left on my thermal pants, but they could have gone too.  Clinton Hunt looks fine, with good cooking facilities, just lacking showers.
</p>

<p>
The moist rain and many ferns reminded me of foggy California, even if the rest of the rest of the environment was different.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258717588">
<p>
At about 11am, we made it to the fork in the Clinton River and stayed left to follow the west fork.  The valley started to narrow, and you could sense that there was more snow mass above, but it wasn’t until almost mile 7 of the track that things started getting interesting and extraordinary.  The waterfall count started climbing greatly, as snowmelt from unseen glaciers tumbled down the hill.  Just short of the lunch hut, we entered the first clearing caused by a slip (of trees, I think).  At the bottom of one waterfall was a pile of snow that had fallen from the crests above.  It was some warm in the valley that I was convinced the pile was a rock pile until Megan (the 3rd guide in the train, we had already fallen behind Travis and Matasuko and about 60 of the other hikers!) confirmed it was snow.  One of the waterfalls visible was Harare Falls (“Falls” Falls).  From certain approaching angles it appeared as if the water just shot off the hillside as if there were a ski jump or big pipe sending all of the water out horizontally.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258721068">
<p>
Near the 8th mile and the bottom of Harare Falls was the lunch hut.  We got there at about 1:30pm, and the fastest packers (the German couple) were just leaving.  We wolfed down our egg salad sandwiches and our snacks.  As we ate the clouds started to break and I saw some free sunrays hitting the trees.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258722896">
<p>
We left lunch and entered the most spectacular series of slides and slips.  These clearings were excellent for letting us look up and down the tightening valley.  Countless waterfalls came from both sides of the valley.  Some hillsides would have five or six parallel waterfalls pouring over the same crest.  The clouds were lifting and even breaking at points, showing slivers of blue and lighting up some peaks.
</p>

<p>
In some areas, signs informed us to keep moving, because we were in avalanche areas.  You could see these areas because all of the tall trees were gone.  Other places had arrowed trail marker poles every 30 feet, indicating where the path was in the event of knee deep floods!
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258725236">
<p>
We spotted some geese and some Blue Ducks.  One duck was riding the river down a rapid, body pointed across the river for steering, head looking downstream to see obstacles.  It was unusual and hilarious!
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258725296">
<p>
The clouds cleared in our part of the valley first, while McKinnsey pass was only slightly visible in the mists.  The right side of the valley was basking in the sun, and the left side had more snowpack and even a few glaciers visible.  One of the small waterfalls of the glacier never touched the ground, as the wind on the mountainside dispersed it as rain.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258726879">
<p>
The final two avalanche zones had fabulous 360-degree views of the valley.  We hustled through while snapping photos side to side.  The last clearing was in a broad, flatter portion of the valley crossed by streams.  Some of the streams were shallow and could be crossed by stepping lightly, others we looked for submerged rocks to step on.  Between mile 9 and 10 was the most flooded portion.  One bridge had not been installed yet, so we ducked upstream and crossed by hopping to a midstream rock.  Then the drainage ditches on the sides of the path were overflowing, and as another hiker said, the Milford Track became the Milford Creek!  We sloshed up, mostly keeping our feet dry, marveling at how clear the stream water is in this valley.  While taking a photo of the 10 mile marker, we heard a distant avalanche!  We did not spot it.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258728986">
<p>
We had a little climb in the last mile of the day, and with the sunshine there were gorgeous path photos to be taken with the big mossy backlit trees and the winding climbing path.  As Kat noted, the beech trees here have such tiny leaves and they let the light though so well.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258729806">
<p>
Pamplona Lodge was reached at 3:30pm.  We got group room #1, showered, washed clothes and rung them in the old fashioned wringer.  There were scones and cream for snack, the sitting room has skylights which let you look up at the waterfalls and glaciers across the valley.   The lodge is in the trees, and on a slope.  Boardwalks connect the various buildings.
</p>

<p>
I walked with a walking stick in my left hand today.  I don’t know if it helped, but it did not hurt.  I will use it again tomorrow on the serious climb.
</p>

<p>
I wrote in the journal until the slide presentation, given by Matasuko, then we ate with Tom(MN), Larry (NH), Stephan and Dana (Victoria, Australia).  We talked about Kat’s work, our trip to Asia, healthcare and energy.  Stephan seems to be involved with the mining industry.
</p>

<p>
After dinner we played cribbage, and we tried to go to sleep early because tomorrow is the strenuous day.
</p>

<p>
Oh, dinner was roasted veggies with lentils.  Our roommates were Heather and Les of the UK.  Heather reminds me of Granny Bev.

Milford Hike Day 3
</p>

<p>
We woke up earlier to make a quick escape.  The alarm was for 6:15am, we had breakfast of scrambled eggs, and we were ready to hit the trail at 7:30am.
</p>

<p>
Travis was lead guide and he wanted us to stay bunched up since he was waiting for a radio call from the rangers Okaying our McKinnsey Pass summit.  They were worried about avalanche danger, and were going to radio down their findings.
</p>

<p>
It was raining hard (as it had been since 3am) and I was torn between taking photos and keeping my camera dry.  We were at the head of the pack with Donna and a few others.  We went through several slip areas, including one that was very recent, the last of which where there was no bridge to cross a significant river.  Travis stepped into the mid-calf high water and tried a view crossing points.  He then stood in the middle of the river and assisted us in crossing.  Everyone ended up with soaked pants and sloshing, water filled shoes.  Peter had on gaiters, and he said his socks only got a little wet.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258793946">
<p>
It was not much further to the free-walker camp at Mintaro Lake.  I was sweating from my three top layers, so I stripped down to just my thermal top and rain shell.  I literally poured the water out of my shoes and then wrung out my socks.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258795302">
<p>
We continued past Mintaro Hut, across a suspension bridge hung from large trees that span the river, through the last valley floor forest and to the foot of the climb. At this point there were a mix of pay and free walkers on the trail together.  We were told there were 13 switchbacks, but I counted maybe more like 18 on the way up.  There were little waterfalls and creeks crossing the trail and plenty of rain and wind additionally.  I was soaked through all layers of my clothing, including my underwear.  I was cold, underdressed and unhappy.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258796967">
<p>
About half way up the climb the trees gave way and we got cloudy views up and down the valley.  At the valley end were steep snowcapped mountains, absolutely running with waterfalls.  In the other direction we could see the Mintaro Lake and then valley was hidden in clouds.  Above the trees the alpine flowers like butter cups and not-daisies were plentiful.  At three-quarters of the way up, we passed a few small patches of snow.  The top was exceptionally cloudy and windy.  The ground flattened and was covered with tussuk grass and many small ponds and bogs.  You could not see into the valleys at all, but from time to time you would get glimpses of the high peaks on either end of the pass through the rushing clouds.

We took the obligatory photos at the McKinney memorial and then started the 20 minute trek along the ridge top to the Summit Hut.  The pelting rain was turning to sleet, I could not see through my glasses for fogging and raindrops.  My hands were not functioning completely and I was a complete grump.  We got into the warming hut and were surprised to see it was heated.  Travis had the stove running boiling water.  Everyone ahead of us was stripping of drenched clothes and putting on dry spares.  We were all steaming and shivering and stomping.  I dumped more water out of my shoes, rung them out again, and then put on dry socks.  Three minutes later my socks were wet again.  I donned my dry long sleeve shirt and wool sweater, ate an egg salad sandwich and a bunch of candy, drank two cups of Milo, and then we set out again.
</p>

<p>
We dropped over the crest shortly and the rain and wind lightened.  As I warmed (I also had a scarf and gloves) my humor got better.  We descended through more flower, and had to turn onto the emergency track since the main track was in avalanche danger.  The emergency track was a streambed in many places, and was much rougher with much deeper steps than those on the main well-constructed track.  (The main track is so nice in the valley that you do not need to watch your step and you can just look up and enjoy the views.)  This track was like a bad New England trail.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258806474">
<p>
By the time we made it back into the trees, the rain had mostly stopped, so I pulled out the camera and tried to make up for the missed photos on the climb and summit.  The trees are very lush there and have the moss too.  The foliage returned to jungle eventually, after we crossed a few broad rushing rivers heading down the mountain.  (One bridge was being reconstructed by trail workers.)  Imagine the lushest prettiest jungle draped with dripping moss and light colored stone paths, and that is what the last half of the descent was like.  We passed a number of waterfall chutes along the way – in fact the trail was a boardwalk and stairs at this portion.  Within one mile of the Quinin Lodge, we started seeing sunshine.  The lodge is at mile 20 of the track.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258813400">
<p>
We had left the Summit Hut at about 11:30am, and we made it to the lodge at about 2:40pm.  The lodge has great views up and down the valley, which is streaming with waterfalls as usual.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258814719">
<p>
We were shown our room, dropped our packs and headed out onto the 1.5 mile (one way) path to Sutherland Falls.  These are three-stage 580m falls that are the tallest in NZ and within the 10 tallest in the world.  On the way up we saw some weka, which we also saw as Mintaro Hut this morning.  This bird looks like a chicken with a duckbill.  The waterfall itself is massively forceful, and sounds like a mix of thunder and jet planes.  My clothes had dried since the morning, yet it only took 3 minutes at the bottom in the spray to be drenched again.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258818200">
<p>
On the way back down from the waterfall we came around the corner and some hikers motioned to us to be quiet.  Walking on the path was a kiwi bird!  It was much larger than I expected, chicken-sized, and was punching its long beak into the earth looking for food.  It was oblivious of us and even walked right next to a hiker’s boots!  Why a kiwi was out at 4pm we don’t know, however this guy had been seen a few times this week in the afternoon.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258819423">
<p>
Back at the lodge we showered and washed clothes.  Kat has a very sore right knee and a busted toenail.  My left knee is sore but not bad – the walking stick may have saved it.
</p>

<p>
At cocktail hour Kat had her moment in the sun, telling everyone her kiwi story and showing her kiwi photos.  She got a good reaction from trampers and guides alike.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, Katrina is feeling sick.  I too have a sore throat.
</p>

<p>
For dinner we talked with Stephen and Inna.  Stephan is a radiologist, Inna a TV journalist.  We talked about Boston, Germany and its concerts, books and TV shows.  Dinner itself was veggies, baked potato and bowl shaped rice pilaf.  Dessert was served with our guides in gorilla costume, wig, bra, big sunglasses, and hula skirts.  Unfortunately, they made their entrance while an EMT helicopter was landing in the lodge field.  Everyone was looking out the window at the time.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258834566">
<p>
The helicopter came and left four times (interrupting the slideshow).  There was an independent hiker that broke her leg one mile from the lodge and the helicopter was to airlift her out.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258837145">
<p>
Lastly, the slideshow was interrupted by a magnificent sunset lighting up the glaciers at the end of the valley.  Everyone ran for cameras.  There was a brilliant orange glow on the snow, and blue and orange sky.  
</p>

<p>
Kelly’s joke of the evening – if you need a guide tonight, “call out for Travis and Meg will come running!”

<p>
Milford Hike Day 4
</p>

<p>
I woke up to find that Katrina only slept one hour, and that she had been up all night with a running nose and chest congestion.  She looked out of it, but was a little improved having taken Excedrin, which contains Tylenol.
</p>

<p>
We collected our drying clothes, ate the usual eggs, toast, tomatoes and porridge breakfast, and then repacked our bags.  We also made egg salad sandwiches for lunch. 
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258876236">
<p>
Gloriously, there was a clear sky this morning, and there was sunrise light on the highest peaks around the valley.  We set of maybe 7th, and moved at a decent clip even considering that Kat was sick.  We got a view of Sutherland Falls from afar, and continued on the right side of the valley.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258879807">
<p>
Our first break was at the free hiker camp (elevation 125m) where we used the toilets and filled up the water sack.  Masako was there talking to the hut ranger about last evening’s heli-evacuation.  The ranger said that a woman broke her leg in her boot, and the bone was protruding forward.  Ten minutes after another hiker came across her and sent help forward.  The ranger said there was some communication mix up that delayed the rescue, and that she was only picked up after two hours.
</p>

<p>
We continued on to the morning tea hut, 5.5 miles into the day’s hike.  The sun coming over the valley walls and lighting the tall peaks was the prettiest thing at this point; the forest here was not so interesting.  Katrina told me that Shaun and Sarah had gotten engaged at Sutherland Falls yesterday.  We did not spot a ring on their fingers.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258885006">
<p>
We got to the morning hut around 10 or 10:30am.  It had been a fishing expedition hut in the past, but was no longer used as such.  I hydrated and ate my first sandwich.  Then we set out again.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258886133">
<p>
It was only three-quarters of a mile from the Boat Shed to Mackay Falls.  We crossed the valley and Arthur River almost immediately, gazing upon its clear green waters, and hiked through floodplain forest before hitting the falls.  Since there was no rain today or last night, most of the waterfall volume was reduced around the valley, and we never needed to wade through any waters.  In fact, we even crossed a few streams that were dry.  Mackay Falls is a short falls with a great green pool at the bottom, and lush jungle all around.  It was very pretty, but since the sun was still rising not properly lit.  We also looked at the outside of the adjacent Bell Rock, a rock with a big pothole in it that now stands flipped upside down.  Neither Katrina nor I wanted to take off our packs and climb inside.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258888483">
<p>
Katrina’s strength really flagged in the subsequent miles of the hike.  She dragged through mile 27 (taking a tissue every half mile – I was the “tissue Sherpa”).  This area was very green, mossy and lush.  We spotted a paradise duck on a log here.  For mile 28 she tried to do a quick pace.  This mile was rather rough and included a section cut into the rock cliff-face by Irish miners.  On mile 29 her strength flagged again by eventually we pulled into the lunch stop at Giants Gate and mile marker 30.
</p>

<p>
Oh, before Mackay Falls we saw a butterfly on the track.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258894884">
<p>
Giants Gate may have been my favorite waterfall of the trip.  You can see it from a suspension bridge.  It is a nice thick fall cutting through a gash in the mossy rock.  Then, there is the clear green pool and green river that follows.  I ate my second sandwich and snacks here.  It was about 1:30pm and the first boat was due to leave at 3:15pm.  Katrina felt like her fever was returning and she really wanted to get on the first boat so she could get in the hotel bed.  We pushed again through mile 30, which was a blur.  Miles 31 and 32 had a few views back up the valley, looking at the rapids flowing out of Lake Ada (which we did not stop to see) and at the snow peaks behind.  In these miles the tree-fern foliage gave way to tall majestically spaced trees and the previously rough path became broad, flat and smooth.  As was true since mile 28 or so, the air had a seaside coolness and saltiness to it.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258900802">
<p>
At the mile 33 marker, we all took congratulatory photos and then completed the last half mile to Sandfly Point.  Kat and I arrived at 2:50pm, beat and happy to stop.  I did not have any blisters on this trip, but my feet were getting hotspots from the 13.5 miles walked today.  My backpack had a tissue box hanging out the back, and side pockets full of used tissue.
</p>

<p>
As for the point’s name, the sandflies were not bad by the hut, just at the tip of the point and by the 33.5 mile sign.  Megan and Masako had cookies and drinks for us in the hut.  I went down near the point and took photos of the fiord and the mountains around the end of Sandfly point.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258902321">
<p>
At 3:15pm, our little launch left carrying 10 or so of the pay hikers and 10 or so stinky free hikers.  Masako was on the boat too.  It was a 15 minute ride out into Milford Sound  We could see the tall, distinct mountains of narrow girth out towards the ocean, and Mitre Peak on the left in the sound.  The launch went out just a little way into the wavy sound waters, before turning right for the port.  We could see the tourist planes and helicopters (the same ones we had been hearing all day long) taking off over the water.  To the side of the port a waterfall could be seen.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258903977">
<p>
We were bused from the port to the hotel (3 minutes) and checked into private rooms with private showers!  After showers, Kat got in bead with a fever.  I went to use the machine washers – exciting!
</p>

<p>
Katrina came out for orientation and dinners.  We ate with Shaun and his Sarah, Ian and his Sarah, Masako, and two others I have forgotten.  Masako told us about various times that hikers decided not to go any further, including one fit hiker that made it to Pomplona Lodge and could not put up with the rain, so he paid for a helicopter out.  Another older couple asked for an airlift off of McKinnon Pass.  In Masako’s three seasons, she has had two medevac cases.  We also talked about Ian’s mining job, and about travel and hiking in China.  Dinner was a nut casserole on potatoes with onions on top.  And a decadent raspberry brownie for dessert.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258913100">
<p>
Katrina went back to the room while I attended the awards ceremony.  We got a folder of pictures and the Day 1 group photo.  Everyone got up and thanked the guides.  Some people shook hands, some hugged, and some even kissed.  I nervously bumbled up, shook the guys’ hands and hugged the girls.  After, Travis thanked us all for being an easy session, and for not any of us being “weirdos”!
</p>

<p>
I retired to the room to play cards with Kat, and to watch the million dollar view from our window go dark.

<p>
Milford Hike Day 5
</p>

<p>
For no good reason beyond hopeless optimism, I was surprised to look out the window this morning and see that it was raining.  Travis had run through the hotel at 7am, knocking on everyone’s doors as a wakeup call.  We looked out the window into a gray void of rain; only the nearest mountains that open onto the fiord were visible, in silhouette.  Katrina was not fevering this morning but was still feeling poor.  She took aspirin overnight and slept, anyhow.
</p>

<p>
We got out to the dining room later than most, and made our last of lunch sandwiches.  There was no egg salad today, so we had cheese and salad sandwiches instead.  The breakfast selection was poorer than usual too.  No hot cereal and very runny scrambled eggs.  No breakfast potatoes either.
</p>

<p>
We went back to the room to finish packing, and then returned our bed sheets and hiking pole to the guides.  They also took our packed bags and labeled them for the bus.  We purchased postcards and Milford Track stamps (cool!) from the gift shop.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258966907">
<p>
At 8:30am we took a shuttle to the Milford Sound port and soon boarded the Milford Sovereign.  They had a second breakfast onboard.  As we motored into the sound it looked like it was going to be a boring 1h 45m since it was still raining and the low clouds were hiding the mountains’ height.  However, the clouds started to lift and the rain slowed as we motored down the sound.  We started by tracing Mitre Peak’s side of the sound (even though we could not see the top of Mitre Peak).  Some passengers claimed to see a dolphin in the water, but I missed it.  Pretty soon we were all outside on the open observation deck looking at the myriad of waterfalls on Mitre Peak’s base.  The captain put the nose of the boat under one of the fullest falls, misting us on deck and then told us that sometimes wood and rocks are washed down the falls!  A later, but nearby, falls of lesser volume ran down the fault line that separates the Pacific and Australian plates.  It is strange to think of a fault line running through such a substantial mass as Mitre Peak.
</p>

<p>
Looking up the steep, steep sides of Mitre Peak, there was mostly gray rock visible.  It climbed steadily but had ripples and twists that form the smaller spiky subpeaks on the way up.  Eventually though, the walls disappear into the foggy mists.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258969101">
<p>
The closer we got to the Tasman Sea, the more the clouds lifted.  Katrina appreciated the spooky atmosphere of the clouds.  I thought the low-hanging cloud that sulked through the fiord was particularly nice.  At the opening of the fiord, winds and waves from the sea greeted us.  We went out far enough to rock in the waves and see that from afar the length of Milford Sound is hidden and a passing ship might consider it an unimportant little bay, as Captain Cook did once upon a time.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258970151">
<p>
On the return, we traced the south edge of the sound, which was also dripping with waterfalls.  Here we passed Seal Rock and saw 15 fur seals resting, probably waiting for sun.  Then, we went to another waterfall where the captain dipped the bow under the spray.  The waterfall s said to take 10 years off of maidens and women if they go under it.  Dana wanted to know why it did not work on blokes too!
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258971854">
<p>
On the way back to port the rain started again.  Amazingly the captain spotted a Fiordland Crested penguin on the rocky shore.  We all took pictures of the little guy with his great big eyebrows.  He tried to hop up the rocks and into the trees, but he could not jump high enough to get over the first rock.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258973848">
<p>
We went from the boat immediately onto the tour bus for Te Anu and Queenstown.  Kat and I sat in the same seats as last time; front left in the second row.  The bus climbed away from the sound (not visible at this point) to the Homer Tunnel (built in the 1930’s to 1950’s).  This valley leading to the tunnel was full of streaming waterfalls; even our guides were impressed by the amount of falls.  The valley was also socked in with clouds, so the views would come and go and never be complete.  We passed a very fresh tree fall area, still muddy.  It takes about 70 years for the forest to regrow.  We also heard how they preemptively close the highway in the winter, when the avalanche danger is too high in certain areas, then bomb those areas with helicopters and spend the next few days cleaning up the provoked avalanche.  The climb culminated in a series of switchbacks up to the Homer Tunnel.  The views were great in the clouds and should be even better in the clear.  Around the switchbacks were piles of dirty snow from avalanches.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258975036">
<p>
The tunnel is roughly cut through the mountain, its first 4’ of walls painted white to increase visibility.  Today the tunnel is monitored by stoplights and only one lane of traffic is allowed.  During the winter two lanes/two directions of traffic is allowed because there is too much avalanche risk at the tunnel entrances to stop traffic.  We also learned there is an annual nude run through the tunnel, and that Megan has completed it!
</p>

<p>
On the other side of the tunnel was a descent past more streaming waterfalls and hidden (fog) valley vistas.  We soon were driving along a wild, rocky river with glacial green waters.  We pasted the valley of the Routeburn hike (Masako says this hike is more above tree line and is not as interesting as the Milford Track) and the Routeburn start as well.  Eventually we descended back into the long valley that leads to Te Anu’s lake.  The bus stopped at a rest station to let us “take a wee break” and pull out our prepacked lunches.  From this stop we could see Door Pass, the overland route to Glade Hut.  This valley was very beautiful because it had a broad floodplain full of lupine flowers of yellow, orange and purple.  The grasses were golden, trees green (but drier than on the Milford Track) and the snowcapped mountains reached west into the Fiordlands.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258978275">
<p>
By this point it had stopped raining.  There were still dark clouds blotting the sky here and there, giving a ceiling to the sky that added height and drama to the mountains.  We passed the start of our ferry to the Milford Track – the wind was very stiff today and one of the guides commented that it looked extra stormy over the track.  (Kelly says that usually it is flooding that causes the guides to end a hike with a helicopter ride home.  Travis has been on hikes called off, but Kelly is still waiting for his free chopper ride.)
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258982352">
<p>
We pulled into Te Anu and the hotel and experienced a strange time warp.  There was a bus of trekkers ready to start the Milford Track, looking inquisitively at our bus for clues about what was to come.  It felt so recent that we had been in their shoes!  Travis joked that we should all put on our best limps as we exited the bus; I tried it for a few steps but could not keep up the farce.  I do feel sore in my calves, but it is not too bad.
</p>

<p>
The new trekkers asked me how bad out of 1-10 the hike was.  Still in the exaggerating mode I went for “13” and a “this big” arm gesture.  In reality I would call the hike a “4” for difficulty, most of it being flat and finished by 4pm and all.  I don’t even remember being much out of breath on the McKinnon climb.  There was a strange feeling in the parking lot though, as if the last four days were on a different timeline, removed from my normal path and aging, and as if I was experiencing starting and completing the trip on the same day.  I don’t feel this was a life-changing hike for me, but it did seem to be removed from time somehow.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1258983690">
<p>
We drove the Te Anu to Queenstown route under the dramatic clouds – the red tussock land was particularly pretty under the clouds and in the strong blowing wind.  We passed the sheep with their offspring, each mother shadowed by one or two lambs.  Passed cattle and deer.  Along the way we watched a nature documentary on the four seasons in the Fiordlands.  There was great helicopter footage – Kelly says one Te Anu company has a 3 hour helicopter ride for $700NZ.  Sounds amazing!
</p>

<p>
The Wakatipu Lake was also gorgeous and windswept.  We even saw two water twisters on the lake surface.
</p>

<p>
We had dropped of two trekkers in Te Anu (plus Masako and Megan, who were joining the outgoing Milford hike) and we dropped off on more at the Queenstown airport.  The rest of us got off at Queenstown station house at 4pm.  Goodbyes were said.  Ina told me to write her if I get to the Nurburgring.  Shaun said Kat and I should email them for a tour of NYC.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259002776">
<p>
We hiked back to Pinewoods and checked in to a new room.  Our apartment mates are two Chinese girls who later made hotpots for dinner.  We purchased red curry in a can from a specialty market and rice and veggies from the supermarket.  (We saw Kelly leaving the market.)  The curry we matched with a Sav Blanc called Tow Tracks from New Zealand’s Marlborough area.  (We bought this one because we got off the Milford Track.)  The wine was very good, the dinner tasty too with broccoli, carrots, peppers and zucchini.
</p>

<p>
After dinner we walked back to town to get Sudafed for Kat.  We were both very tipsy at this point, but tried to reinternalize our running thoughts.  In the pharmacy we say Ian’s Sarah – I hardly recognized her in her street clothes; I am still in hiking gear.  Kat bought the decongestant ($18 NZ!) and we looked into a gift shop and then headed back to the hotel.  It was already 9:15pm and the sun was starting to go down.
</p>

<p>
Oh, there were many Chinese tourists in town this evening.  Perhaps Guilin Nick could lead a tour to Queenstown.  I think he would be impressed by how crystal clear the air is in NZ.
</p>

<p>
My calves ache after all our hiking.  My left knee is a little stiff too, but not so bad.
</p>

<h3><a name="091124">11/24/09</a></h3>
<p>
Queenstown
</p>

<p>
We slept in late and made breakfast (oatmeal and honey) in our room.  Planning to drive to Glenoarchy and back today, we told reception we were staying one more night, then used the internet to write our families.
</p>

<p>
At 11:40am, the Apex car rental van came to pick us up.  Apex tried to “upgrade” me to an 8 person minivan, which I refused.  We got the EU Focus we wanted in manual with blue paint.
</p>

<p>
We left the rental shop and headed directly for Glenoarchy at the northmost tip of Lake Wakatipu.  On the road the Focus reminded me of Toby’s Audi A3 – solidly built with steady road manners, a smooth engine with good midrange power, chunky indicator stalks and upscale “dong” noises, soft touch dash, reduced visibility as a result of the high haunches.  Apex warned me that the turn indicated in this car was on the wrong side, the left side of the wheel – this is a perfect fit for an American.  Again, the car is mostly hushed and very solid on the road.  I like it a lot, but wish it took regular fuel.
</p>

<p>
It is a 40km, 40 minute drive along the lakeside to Glenoarchy.  We found more lupines along the road and at the end of the lake we would see many glacier capped mountains.  The road itself is nice and winding, about like CA Hwy 1.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259069098">
<p>
In Glenoarchy we stopped at the info center and got a tourist map of the area.  The Routeburn track ends up one for of the valley and we had been thinking of hiking a bit of it.  The info guy dissuaded us, saying the bush socked in the views until we passed the first hut and that we could not go that far since there was avalanche danger and the hikers were being helicoptered though the area today!  He named some other options, but where we he said that Paradise Valley and the Dart River track was the filming area for the Lord of the Rings, we knew where we were going.
</p>

<p>
First though, we stopped at the Glenoarchy Café for pumpkin leek soup, veggie sandwiches and tea.  It was very reasonable, just NZ$20 in total, and was tasty too.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259070629">
<p>
We drove north to the Paradise Road, a dirt road leading to the Dart Track start.  This road winds past cattle and sheep farms, and then enters Mt Aspiring National Park.  All along the way there are great north-looking views of tall, densely snowcapped mountains.  There was no rain today, but some clouds added drama.  Furthermore, the lupines along the road added color.  The most beautiful view may have been just before entering the park proper, near the riding stables, where scrubby trees dot the sheep field, the Dart River valley is down to the west and several sharply shaped snow mountains form a distant northern horizon.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259072291">
<p>
In the park the broad dirt road narrowed and became harder packed.  We also sent through forest land (probably not old growth) that was drier and less mossy than the Milford forests.  I got to ford five streams in my Ford (ha ha!), none of them were more than 5” or 6” deep.  Most of the nearby snowpack had already melted.
</p>

<p>
Kat and I are both sick at this point – Kat doped up on Sudafed yet still needed a tissue roll for her nose.  I have the sniffles and a post nasal drip, but mostly have a swollen, scratchy throat.  As such, our hiking ambitions where small this afternoon.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259075379">
<p>
We did one hour or so on the west entrance to the Dart River track.  My goal was to walk to a good viewpoint for a huge waterfall coming down the mountain on the west side of the Dart River.  The track was on the east bank.  First it wound along a forested hillside, sometimes cut into the rock of the hill.  Then it came out onto the grass covered floodplain of the river.  This plain was very beautiful with the mountains rising to the west and north, the glaciers to the north, the green silty river running in a broad rocky basin, Chinaman’s Bluff cliffs to the east.  Perhaps some of Lord of the Rings was filmed here?
</p>

<p>
The Dart River is a jet boat destination, and we say two boats zip by.  We then started the climb up the wooded side of Chinaman’s Bluff to get a better view of our huge waterfall.  After 5 minutes a viewpoint was reached and we could watch this massive cascade start seemingly as the top of the mountain and tumble and zag all of the way to its base.  We guessed correctly that a lake must feed this fall.
</p>

<p>
We got back to the car park and saw a 4x4 tour Land Rover drive up and head for the river.  I hoped we would see it ford the Dart River, but I think it probably just stopped for photos. 
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259080600">
<p>
We drove back to the paved road and headed one valley west to the dirt road to the Routeburn track.  This road was pretty, but not as spectacular as Paradise Road.  It was maybe 15 minutes to the Routeburn track end hut, which we did not explore outside of the car.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259086324">
<p>
Tired and sick, we returned to Queenstown and purchased dinner makings at the Fresh Choice supermarket.  Dinner was couscous, asparagus and tomatoes.  I also finally found regular salted corn chips, and bought three bags!  Now we are writing postcards and making hostel reservations for the next few towns.
</p>

<p>
Oh, I learned today that Milford Sound is only 30 miles from Lake Wakatipu – how strange, it feels so much further away.
</p>

<p>
Oh #2, we say some green little parrots when leaving the Dart Track.  We are not sure what they are named.

After packing and oatmeal, we started the drive to Fox Glacier via the Mt Aspiring Hwy 6 pass.  First we wound out of Queenstown, past the put-in location for the Shotover River for jet boats and then to the gold-town-turned-tourist-town Arrowhead.  The main street was spruced up to look gold rush like, but had the art galleries, cafes and Thai restaurants of touristdom.  Katrina wonder if all gold rush areas look the same, because there were dry brown hills/mountains here too, just like in CA.
</p>

<p>
We took the local route to Wanaka on the twisty Crown Ridge Rd.  The road climbed up and over the dry gold hills with the yellowish tussuk cover.  We had a glimpse or two of Queenstown, and of the valley over which our JetStar flight did its spiral descent.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259144338">
<p>
It was dry all morning and even warmer in Wanaka at 22*C.  Here we paused at the lake view, cruised the pleasant main street, and then stopped in the Mt Aspiring DOC visitor center to get a map (and a Penguin necklace as a gift).  One young American was getting advice on a hike from the rangers, but ignoring their pleas that he try a different track with less snow danger.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259146330">
<p>
Just out of Wanaka we stopped at Puzzling World.  We checked out the illusion world rooms, 1980’s holograms, impossible paintings, a tilted funhouse room, a Ames room to make you look big or small, an inverted masks room that makes the faces seem to follow you.  It was moderately fun.  At the gift shop I got a 4x4 rubix cube as a gift for Sam.  We also ate some savory muffins and took pictures on the exterior lawn.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259150891">
<p>
We drove north along two lakes of brilliant green waters (maybe NZ stole the Caribbean waters?).  The first lake had dry mountains around it, and stiff winds blowing up dust on the north side.  At this lake Kat dropped her camera and broke a UV filter; thankfully the camera is ok.  The second lake had snowcapped mountains of Aspiring Park to the north, but also rainclouds on the skyline!
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259154579">
<p>
Our first stop in the park was at the Blue Pools.  It was a 15 minute walk over two suspension bridges to the pools, but they were neither pools nor blue.  Instead, they were a floury glacial river.  This was disappointing.  At least the main river of the valley had some blue and was pretty, parting the green mountains disappearing into the clouds.  
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259157381">
<p>
It started raining almost immediately after the Blue Pools.  Because we were both sick and because the clouts would have blocked any view anyway, we skipped the Haast Pass hikes and instead visited a few waterfalls right off the road.  One of the falls had a rocky beach nearby where many visitors build cairns out of rocks.  It felt kind of religious.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259162611">
<p>
In increasing rain we descended from the park to the coast.  IN the town of Haast we filled up the tank (NZ$59 for three-quarters tank!) and ate lunch at a nearby café.  There was not much on the menu for us, but we had tomato soup and fries, lots of fries!  The catsup said Heinz but did not taste right.  The café had a big central fireplace, around which a bunch of Harley riders were taking shelter from the rain.  There were also deer heads on the walls.  On the walls of the Men’s room were “If you drink and drive you’re a bloody idiot” posters.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259165224">
<p>
We drove 100 miles north along the coast to Fox Glacier.  It rained the whole time and the road went mostly straight along the coastal flatlands, through tall jungle forest which I could imagine in Florida.  Before going into town, we stopped at the glacier access lot to see what could be seen.  There is a glacier cut stream/river bed with a tall cliff on one side and sloping, sliding mountains on the other.  We could see the terminal end of the glacier, dirty and blue, through the rain.  We asked a soaked tour participant who was wearing a tour-provided jacket, rain pants, boots and red socks if it was worth it.  She said she was soaked all the way through, should have dressed warmer, was keen on getting into the spare set of dry clothes back at home, but yeah, it was worth it.  Kat and I are skeptical, but cannot cancel our tour so we will see what tomorrow brings.
</p>

</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259172186">
<p>
Our hostel was Ivory Towers (NZ $75).  It was a nice place with personal touches from the owners.  All around the halls and common areas are inspirational/motivational posters.  The funniest was “Aspire”, which shows a guy riding away from the rising sun…or is it a nuclear bomb explosion!  In the kitchen there is a fantastic table/work surface made from the trunk of a large tree.
</p>

<p>
Kat and I skipped dinner (so many fries at lunch!) and watched the first Lord of the Rings in our room.  It was raining throughout the movie, but may have stopped once or twice.

<p>
Thanksgiving - Fox Glacier
</p>

<p>
It was not raining this morning, so we prepared to go on the Fox Glacier tour.  We ate oatmeal as usual, and put on every layer we could think of.  I had thermal top and bottom, pants, t-shirt, long sleeve shirt, wool sweater, fleece vest and rain shell, plus gloves, scarf and hat ready!  When packing this morning, I discovered my cell phone is missing.  I can imagine leaving it at Pinewoods in Queenstown, or putting it in an exterior pocket of my daypack and having the phone drip out.  Oh well.  My sore throat from yesterday turned into a runny nose today, making me slow and disorderly getting out the door.
</p>

<p>
We did make it no problem to our 8:35am half-day tour of Fox Glacier.  They gave us old, warm, basic boots, socks (red or green), crampons and a rain jacket which I put on top of my five other layers!  Since the rain had passed over night, we did not need rain pants.  We learned that last year had more than 200 rainy days here, where 7 meters of rain is normal.
</p>

<p>
They bused us to the glacier and told us where the glacier resided 200 and 75 years ago.  Let’s say that the glacier has receded 1km.  Each of the two guides took on about 15 tourists, and we walked one hour, first along the rock riverbed deposits and then climbing up the mountainside 800 steps, through rainforest, along a ledge where we were instructed to keep our hands on a chain safety line, passed a drinkable waterfall and passed several slip areas that the guide, Scott of Dunedin, first investigated before we made it to the glacier.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259231253">
<p>
Because of the somewhat low clouds, the glacier went as far as the eye could see up the mountain valley.  It was dirtier than expected, with rock crumble sprinkled on the exposed ice.  It had igloo blue coloring and in direct sunlight it shined – from the recent rain Scott said.
</p>

<p>
During the one hour walk/wait up to the glacier edge, we lost three members of the group because of fear of heights.  They were a mother, father and daughter from Singapore.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259232866">
<p>
At the glacier, we each got a walking pole with a metal peg tip for extra stability, and we were shown how to attach our crampons to our boots.  Scott then took us along a train maintained by the tour company on the glacier’s surface.  To walk on this path of ice steps over hills and valleys straight might have taken 15 minutes.  However our ice time was extended to 45 minutes by stopping frequently and giving us photo opportunities.  The only new glacial feature I learned about were the moulins, locations where surface streams on the glacier spiral round and round and bore holes through the surface of the ice into the interior water flows.
</p>

<p>
We learned that Fox Glacier grows when 100’s of feet of snow is dumped in the mountains overhead.  The weight of the snow forces the bottom snow layers to squirt out, down the mountainside.  In some places the glacier moves three meters a day.  The water for now comes from wind/storms blowing in from Australia.  In recent years global warming caused more evaporation and water in the Westerlies, actually causing Fox Glacier to grow.  However, the growth could quickly turn around if things get much warmer.  Also, with Australian wind comes Australian dirt; much of the dirt in and on the glacier is from overseas.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259234904">
<p>
After tromping around on the glacier, taking photos in our provided outfits with our Christmas color socks, checking out the more shattered, spiky ice further uphill, we ended the tour and headed back to town.  (By then I had expended two partial toilet paper rolls as tissue.)  We shared flatbread, cheese dips and a Greek salad at a café across the street from the tour office.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259244718">
<p>
Katrina drove us north along the coast for 130km to Hokitika.  We drove through more forests, along a lake or two, through long flat pastoral stretches, over many wide riverbeds that must only fill at snow melt, and over a coastal mountain or two.  In Hokitika – which is a medium sized town on a beach – we looked in the jade/greenstone factory stores for gifts from NZ.  All of the “factory priced” pieces were NZ $100 or more, so we ended up with mother of pearl Koru twists instead.  In a local artisans co-op (“only 20% commission on pieces”), Katrina and I found nice local wood cheese boards and spiral coasters for our parents and grandparents.  There were also a number of very lovely watercolor paintings of NZ mountains that I admired.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259255267">
<p>
We topped up the tank again in Hokitika (19 liters for 289 km is about ~36 mpg) and soon turned inland for Arthur’s Pass.  Oh, reading the map along the way I say a number of interesting place names like Mt Awful, Notown town, Abut Head, and some other gems too.  At first the road followed a broad river valley, pretty under the light of the lowering sun but with misty rainclouds approaching.  The clouds were high enough for us to see over the tree line and even spot some snow on high.  Then the road turned south and travelled through a tightening valley of bright yellow Scott’s Broom.  The road then climbed steeply up a tight tumbling river gorge to the pass, in the shadows of Mt Guinevere and Mt Lancelot.  We stopped to inspect an overlook but there was no view, only a Kea trying to disassemble the undercarriage of a camper.  When we were trying to find the view, the Kea turned on our car and took some hardware off the windshield wipers!  These birds are ballsy!
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259260685">
<p>
We crested the pass in the setting sun, with the rain clouds coming up the mountain behind us.  I tried to get a photo of the snowcaps, but I was shooting into the sun and I don’t believe the photo turned out.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259262898">
<p>
Just over the crest we found our lodging in the town of Arthur’s Pass.  The Mountain Lodge rented us a room in a shared cottage.  Warm colored walls, tall ceilings and a wood fire stove make this our nicest backpacker’s lodging yet.  We ate chili (canned) and rice for dinner, guessed that we saw a gray kiwi based on the poster in the dining area, and had our dishes washed for us by kind fellow tourists from England.
</p>

<p>
Oh, on the glacier we heard the Maori tale about how the glacier was formed.  An ice princess that lived at the top of the mountain visited the beach and fell in love with a Maori warrior.  The warrior would climb up the valley frequently to meet his love.  One time on the way up he was killed, and when the ice princess heard she cried two long streams of tears that became the Fox and Franz Josef glaciers.

Akaroa
</p>

<p>
Last night I had horrible mucus flow that kept waking me up.  I had a hard time finding a comfortable sleeping position that would let me breathe.  Finally, in the morning the flow slowed and I was able to sleep.  As such, Katrina let me sleep in until 8am and even offered breakfast in bed, which I took at the table instead.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259314107">
<p>
We left our fabulous little cottage with Katrina driving.  There was actually much more of the park to the east than I expected.  The landscape was dry, like high desert mountains and some of the mountains lower down looked built of gravel.  The first think we entered into was a very broad T-junction river valley, with snowcapped mountains to the west and south.  This river valley had many rock strewn dry riverbeds – if these ever all fill the valley would look to be filled with water.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259315930">
<p>
Again, the mountains got drier as we descended, most had no tree cover.  We passed 3 or 4 ski stations.  A new geological feature was limestone “tors” on several hilltops.  These looked like glacial erratics to me, but may have been park of the hill itself.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259318749">
<p>
Eventually we descended into farm country and flatland near Springfield.  At one road works just past Sheffield, we were approaching the one-lane control lights as they were turning read.  I told Katrina to just go anyway, which she did, but then all of the sudden we were beached in a long gravel pile that would have been placed on the yellow lines had the road been paved.  Distraught, Kat and I quickly switched seats and I pulled the car out of the gravel pile and out of the road works.  We got a WTF look from the follow me road works guy says Kat.  The car was making new noises after its adventure, so we double back to Sheffield to find a service station.  Not finding one, Katrina called AA for roadside assistance while I removed the front right tire to see where the noises were coming from.  There was gravel in the wheels, in the suspension and undertray, and next to a belt pulley.  We dislodged what we could with sticks and when the AA boy arrived he removed the rest, graciously.  
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259325522">
<p>
Back on the road around 12:30pm, we took Route 72 as a shortcut to Christchurch.  One of the approaching cars flashed its lights as we neared a corner, so I though a cop must be close.  Nope.  Instead the read was full of bleating scared sheep being herded to a new field by two or three farmers in pickups.  There were a couple of dogs in the back of each pickup, barking furiously at the sheep.  The farmers would drive (rather quickly) at the back of the herd, honking numerous times and scaring the sheep to run forward and away.  We were in traffic travelling the same direction as the sheep, so we could not stop and just let the spectacle pass.  The lead car was trying to edge his way through the herd, but not really making any progress.  Sheep were crossing from side to side in front of the cars, forcing slow progress so we did not hit one.  When they were running scared, sometimes a sheep would leap and those following him would leap too, creating a cascade of leapers.  Having never seen a sheep jump before, this was fantastic to watch.  The sheep really launch themselves into the air, as high as they are tall.  Eventually the new field was reached and the sheep were cleared from the road.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259326414">
<p>
In West Melton we stopped at a cherry farm and got some early season cherries.  Then we remerged with Hwy 73 and continued into Christchurch.  We made it to an outskirts supermarket and shopped for Thanksgiving dinner foods.  We found potatoes, green beans, and cranberry sauce for our meal.  (This morning in Arthur’s Pass Kat and I called our families to say Happy Thanksgiving.  It was 8*C then, now in the valley it was 18*C.)
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259335332">
<p>
We started to drive into the city center, but the traffic was so discouraging that we turned around and headed for Akaroa, 75km away in a volcanic (extinct and eroded) peninsula.  We drove south then east out of Christchurch, stopping in Little River at the café to eat a piece of quiche and use the restrooms.  After Little River Hwy 57 climbed into and over the volcanic hill pastures (cows and sheep of course!) with their nice green grass and dropped us by Berry’s Bay.  We saw a cheese factory here and stopped in the store and bought Maasdam cheese.  Through the shop windows we could see them making this cheese in front of us.  We then drove around the bay that cuts into the old volcano cone/core to the town of Akaroa proper.  This town has French heritage from when France hoped to colonize NZ but arrived just after the British claimed NZ.  The streets are “rue”, the police “guardemere”, and there are some bakeries I cannot wait to try.  We checked into the very pretty and purple Chez la Mer Backpackers and got a lovely lavender room with street views.  While I did our laundry, Katrina prepared our “best of” Thanksgiving dinner.  We ate at around 5pm – it was good through I can hardly taste as congested as I am – and then went on a walk around town.  
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259347369">
<p>
The town has tourist shops and eateries, but never feels touristy.  It is on the bay and the town’s long beach splits it into two halves.  We are staying on the north half.  Katrina liked picking up “unicorn horn” shells on the beach; I enjoyed looking across the waters at the green rolling hills on the other side.  We also liked the many roses, cats, and small wood cottages in town.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259350727">
<p>
At the end of our walk we got in the car and drove the closer half of Summit Road to look down on the town at sunset.  How pretty!  It is green pasture all the way down the hills, the murky green bay nestles in the pastoral horseshoe with small towns in the calm harbors.  Kat says she could move here – she likes this the most of all we have seen in NZ.  I like it here too, but I am not sold on NZ life.

Christchurch
</p>

<p>
Last night my nose was clear enough to let me sleep well.  We got up after 7am and went into town (Akaroa) for a hot breakfast.  We were going to try the corner bakery, but they did not have many traditional breakfast plates, so we just bought bread instead (to see if they have the French “technology”; they don’t) and an apple pastry.  We ended up eating at Bully Haze because it looked busy.  It turned out that the customers were a party from Cadbury, so we could have gotten a false reading on how popular the restaurant was.  I had bagel and eggs, Katrina had French toast and fried banana.  Both were good, but not great.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259402241">
<p>
I wanted to take the scenic route back to Christchurch, so we cut up and over the core of the peninsula to Pigeon Bay, a north-facing bay.  This section of island has green rolling hills and pastures like there are on Bloomfield Rd in Sebastopol – I could have been home in the winter!  Along the bayside road were fantastic blooms of purple sweet peas.  It was drizzling a fog-like drizzle that dulled the greens of the bay waters.  There were fewer houses in this area.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259403392">
<p>
Then we got on the “Not suitable for caravans” Port Levy-Pigeon Bay Road.  This road is a one-lane dirt road that climbs over the inland mountains to the next bay west, Port Levy.  Thankfully, we were the only car on this road, because there was no room to pass.  We were hemmed in between sheep fields on both sides, climbing 500’ above the valley floor.  We saw our first two rabbits of the trip, big bunnies the size of lap dogs.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259405193">
<p>
The Purau - Port Levy Road was paved and also climbed through pasture.  In Purau and Diamond Harbor the summer home density shot way up, as did the number of sailboats in the harbors.  This must be vacationland for Christchurch.  The houses we passed as we wiggled to the city were built on the hillsides (like in Marin) and concealed from the road by trees and bushes.
</p>

<p>
We went over Dyers Pass into the suburb of Cashmere; we might as well have been in San Francisco for the poshness of the neighborhoods on these hills.  Down below were the towers of central Christchurch.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259408022">
<p>
We walked around some of the park space in the city center, starting in Victoria Square, then along Oxford Terrace, over to Latimer Square and then back to Cathedral Square.  It was cold, still drizzling and not that British.  It looks like an ok town but not that interesting for walking and not shopping.  Maybe we just explore cities the wrong way, but this was not Boston or Barcelona.  In a bookstore Kat bought some kiwi Christmas cards.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259418019">
<p>
From Christchurch we drove north, getting on Hwy 1 (2 lanes in each direction for only five minutes!) and then stopping at Waipara Springs Winery for a wine tasting.  There were concentrations of vineyards around Waipara, but nothing as large as in Sonoma.  For NZ $4 we tried six wines each, including two rieslings, one sauvignon blanc, two chardonnays, two pinot noir, and one gerwerterminer.  Whenever we tried two of the same wine, we were trying the normal and reserve varieties of that wine.  Both Rieslings were excellent, the best of the tasting, but the reserve was superb.  We purchased two bottles of this one.  The Chardonnays were also very good; Katrina liked the cheaper younger one that punched harder at the first sip, rather than the mellower, complex and evolving reserve.  Kat and I thought the Chardonnays do not taste like any Chardonnay we have had before.  The pinots were nice, reminding us of Sam and Tina’s wedding wine.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259420282">
<p>
Tipsy, we made lunch at a picnic table in the garden, preparing tomato, avocado, humus, cheddar (“extra tasty”!) apple sandwiches in the cold and intermittent rain, taking our time to recover from the tasting.
</p>

<p>
We then continued on Hwy 1 north to Kaikoura.  There were more green rolling hills turning into small coastal mountain passes and Sonoma County-esque landscape.  Perhaps the “CA” landscapes are just an acknowledgement that a green pasture on a rolling hill looks the same in NZ as it does in the USA?
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259426059">
<p>
The last portion of the road wound along the rocky, low coast.  At Otumatu Rock, we saw seals on the beach and took photos.  This is probably as close to a wild seal as I have been.  We also saw surfers with wet suits in the water.  Just like the rest of NZ, the ocean here is light blue green.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259429057">
<p>
We got to Kaikoura at 5pm and drove to the Tiptop Hostel, which Kat booked this morning.  No one was there and the facility was closed!  Some grounds keepers appeared and told us the phone calls are being forwarded to the “Lazy Shag”.  We drove over to that unfortunately named hostel and found our booking.  We have a room with a private bath.  The place is clean, modern (all sliding glass doors) and acceptable, but without charm.  Oh well, whatever.  However, I did hear my first “sweet as” used in the wild here.
</p>

<p>
We made toast and tea, then logged onto the internet.  No one has replied to our last email – perhaps the holiday craze has hit home?  Katrina got contact information for her Aunt Lisa’s NZ friend, an NZ ambassador!  Kat sent her an email, but we are not sure what to do with the contact.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259438204">
<p>
In the evening, we went for a drive along the Kaikoura waterfront, out to the peninsula where seals breed.  Here there are crinkly limestone rocks that are exposed seafloor extending gently down to the water.  On the south end big waves were breaking on the rocks.  A few seals were sleeping on the rocks.  One of the signs said the seals can be at sea for as many as three weeks!
</p>

<p>
We also drove through town.  There are many hotels, bars and restaurants here.  It does not take too many blocks inland before the farmland returns.
</p>

<p>
We are not so hungry, so we are skipping dinner tonight.
</p>


</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259483454">
<h3><a name="091129">11/29/09  Queen Charlotte Sound</a></h3>

<p>
We ate at the hostel, then got in the car and drove north.  Katrina had a bad night – feeling ill with headache and throwing up – and she was not fully recovered today.  We drove 1.5 or 2 hours north through Blenheim to Picton.  The roads started out along the ocean, with the railway running parallel, then crossed up through the hills and dove down into Marlbourough County.  The hills are following valley could be like coming over the Petaluma hills and entering Sonoma wine country.  Marlbourough Valley around Blenheim has quite a few wineries, though most of the vines look very young.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259493778">
<p>
After Blenheim we crossed one more set of hills before entering Picton, the town of the interisland ferry.  While Blenheim looked sizable and not tourist focused, Picton seems to revolve around the ferry service.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259494364">
<p>
We bought lunch and dinner supplies in the supermarket, then got on the Queen Charlotte Scenic Drive to Nelson.  This is the slow road to Nelson, posted at 50kph, but it has views into the sounds on the north of the South Island.  The mountains forming these sounds are not so high, maybe 500’ or 1000’ high, and are forested in evergreen and fern pine.  The waters in the sound are (again) exceptionally pretty; light blues and greens.  We stopped and ate lunch looking down on Governor’s Bay.  Our lunch was a loaf of spinach feta bread dipped in sundried tomato spread plus an apple.  We could very easily imagine we were looking down on a Caribbean beach from our pullover.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259498316">
<p>
The sun, glasses and twisties were getting to Katrina and making her sick.  We stopped to get air and walk on the Queen Charlotte Track to clear our heads. We walked up to the first bay, barely 40 minutes in one direction, through the pine and fern forest looking down on the green waters. The forest here looked as if it had burnt 20 years ago, for the largest trees were charred.  
</p>

<p>
The track allows bikes until Dec 1, so there were many mountain bikers on the path.  Katrina says it is a 3-5 day bike ride to the end!  You can also hire boats to carry your gear to your next night’s lodging.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259500517">
<p>
Davies Bay beach was a broad and – since the tide was out – had exposed mud and seaweed.  Some cranes were picking through the empty clam shells looking for food.  We sat and soaked up the sun (24 Celsius at its high today, clear skies) and enjoyed the waters.  People kayak, Jet Ski, boat and sail these bays/sounds.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259504681">
<p>
We walked back to the car, enjoyed a boysenberry, raspberry froze pop, and then continues on to Nelson.  The remaining road until Rt-6 was again very twisty and passed a second bay/sound, with the tide way out.  Rt-6 was a great road, like Hwy 128 between Cloverdale and Greenwood Ridge Road, that cleaved through the mountains and swept down back to the sea.  There were a few motorcycles bombing the curves; I tried to be smooth as Katrina had her eyes closed.
</p>

<p>
I was quite surprised by how large Nelson and its neighboring cities are.  It is spread along a bay (the tide was out showing lots of mudflats) and reaches more than an hour’s drive north!  We drove to Motueka with the ambitious goal of seeing Golden Bay before sunset.  In Nelson, we went along beaches full of Sunday bathers and kite boarders.  Then we went right in Richmond to drive north and past along more wine country and tidal flats.  Many people had placed rocks in the mud writing messages.  Motueka had one long main street along the highway, with evidence of alternative-lifestyle businesses.  We tried to stop at an organic vegetarian friendly café to feed hungry Katrina and raise her spirits (and blood sugar) but at 4:45pm on Sunday they were already closed!  Only the crystal shop adjacent was open!  
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259513591">
<p>
We drove out to Moteuka’s sand spit and bird sanctuary since we did not have the stamina to drive to the north end of Abel Tasman National Park and then over to Golden Bay.  There were not many birds to be found, just a walking/running/biking path along the beach with friendly locals taking the air.  I walked out onto a tiny sandspit island to take photos, and in 3 minutes the tide had closed around the island.  I took off my shoes and waded (ankle high) back to shore.  At mostly low tide the beach is rocky, so we built two cairns and then left.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259519952">
<p>
Back in Moteuka we stopped at the Swinging Sultan and got Kat a falafel.  The shop was run by a white woman, and used organic food when possible.  I thought my wrap was good.  The advertisements on the walls could have been from West County for all the alternative healing and yoga postings present.  On, I spotted a Waldorf School here too!
</p>

<p>
We took the Moutere Scenic drive back, which was actually quicker because of less traffic and no road works.  This route passed more country vineyards and olive and citrus groves.  The apple trees here are only 8’ tall and rather delicate looking, perhaps they are good to pick without ladders.
</p>
</span>
<p>
Our Nelson hostel is the Nelson Paradiso.  It is very large (96 beds!) and has a pool which is refreshingly cool.  We are in room 13, which has 3 beds if you count the two in the loft over our heads.  Kat made black beans and rice for dinner – the kitchen was swamped with guests cooking – I had to wash other peoples’ dishes in order to find clean forks.  We also tried a local Chardonnay which was enjoyable but not exceptional.  This hostel has lots of perks like breakfast and dinner foods, a pool, free tours, etc.  At NZ $30 per person per night, how long could I vacation?  Also, lots of NZ hostels have single wood slab furniture in their kitchens.  How cheap is such a table?  In the USA they would be too pricy for hostel use.

<h3><a name="091130">11/30/09  Abel Tasmin Park</a></h3>


<p>
We had planned to get up early and take a taxi boat inside Abel Tasman Park.  However, it was raining when we got up, so we rolled over and slept some more.
</p>

<p>
We ate the hostel’s free cereal and toast, then went into town because we did not know what else to do with the rain.  Nelson’s downtown is maybe eight blocks of pedestrian friendly shopping, mainly travel, books and clothing stores.  We looked in the toy store and in a NZ gift shop.  Katrina bought a tea towel for Tessa.  We walked around for exactly 1 hour (as that was how long our parking was good for) and did not know what to do next.  We considered going to the wearable arts museum, but were not enthused.  The rain was letting up, so we decided to leave and go to Abel Tasman Park by car instead.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259584875">
<p>
We left at 11:30am and it took almost 2 hours to get up to Takaka.  We stopped at a local fruit and vegetable stand and got real cheap strawberries and apples on the way.  The drive went over a super twisty pass after Moteuka that climbed out of the vineyards, apple, cherry and kiwi orchards and over the back of the park.  The pass was as twisty as Hwy 1 along the Navarro River.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259586915">
<p>
Katrina said Takaka is the true hippy town and that Moteuka hardly keeps up.  She is right – just into town we say numerous poncho-wearing women and a few barefoot walkers as well.  We stopped on main street and ate at the Wholemeal Café.  Kat had an eggplant and tomato curry with lots of spice.  I had the soup of greens and potatoes, which was also tasty.  The restaurant is supposed to be vegetarian, but only half of the menu was fish and meat free.  Maybe it was vegetarian inspired?
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259588879">
<p>
Kat go a raspberry brownie on the way out the door and we continued south into Abel Tasman’s north end.  Being afternoon, the tide was out.  We wound along some nice limestone cliffs and past a fast mudflat, part of which forms the park’s coastal track.  There was also pasture land (and Pukeko birds) along the tidal areas.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259591308">
<p>
We then left the paved road and climbed up a dirt road into the park’s forest.  This forest looks like old growth, but I don’t know if it actually is.  It is very dense, with nice palm trees and fern trees mixed in.  As it was drizzling, the dirt road was wet and I nearly put the Car into a ditch at one muddy part!  Proceeding extra carefully, we completed the 10km trip up and over the mountain and then down to the campgrounds in Totaranui.  We parked and then walked south 50 minutes on the coastal track
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259592738">
<p>
The immediate and first sight was the beach at Totaranui.  When damp, it is the color of yellow corn meal!  No wonder this area is called Golden Bay.  It is quite a long beach and has nice green forests backing it.  We hiked along the hillside (in the forest) to Skinner Point and looked back on the beach.  At the ends of the beach it turns to rocks that protrude into the green waters.  We saw signs suggesting that penguins live in the area, but we did not spot any.  There were black and white fishing birds (cormorants?) but not much else.
</p>

<p>
From the forest drive I had hoped the forest would be as pretty as the Milford Track’s forest.  Nope!  I still had that waiting disinterestedly feeling between viewpoints.  There were lots of fern trees, vines and infrequent lupines.  We also spotted one or two massive trees with ecosystems of ferns and grasses on them.  We walked to Goat Bay Beach (as that is part of the track) and tried to go south to the next beach, but became impatient and turned around.  On the way back to the car Kat found a cool seashell with a spiral/koru shape.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259599458">
<p>
At about 4:30pm we retraced our course to Nelson.  The muddy road was not as scary on the return, as I could anticipate the tricky spots.  The roads leading up to and climbing the pass to Moteuka are great fun, first with high speed sweepers then twisty climbing mountain roads.  It took 2 hours just to return to Motueka, then maybe 1 hour more to return to Nelson.
</p>
</span>
<p>
We picked up some Pinot Noir downtown before returning to the hostel.  We could tatsoi from the fruit and vegetable stand with garlic, plus ate the free potato, carrot, cabbage soup provided by the hostel – after adding salt it tasted just fine.  Tipsy, we retired to our room to sleep and prepare mentally for tomorrow’s ferry to the North Island.
</p>

<p>
Oh – at dinner some foreign tourists were looking at farm work locations in the WWoof guide.  There are lots of listings for every region!  And this is just for organic farms!  Maybe Katrina should do a summer here.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259670497">

<h3><a name="091201">12/1/09  Wellington</a></h3>

<p>
This morning it was raining again.  We showered, and I shaved my longest beard yet.  I enjoyed doing the thinker’s chin-beard grab, but it is fine to be clean again.  We left the Nelson hostel – our least appealing of the trip – and headed into Nelson downtown for a bit to see if I could find and All Blacks rubgy shirt as a Christmas gift for Tucker.  All of the official shirts where NZ $50-$150 which was more than I had hoped.  The unofficial ones were not as interesting.
</p>

<p>
At 10am we left empty handed to catch the Picton-Wellington car ferry.  I hustled the whole way – our only stop was to ask for directions – and going the scenic Queen Charlotte route back we did the journey in just less than two hours.  Unfortunately, I hit my 3rd or 4th bird on the way.
</p>

<p>
We had a little time before we needed to queue for the ferry at 12:15pm.  So we went back to the Fresh Choice supermarket and go sea salt and vinegar chips, spinach feta bread, and humus and sundried tomato dip.
</p>

<p>
We queued for the ferry (Interisland Lines) and waited in a staging area as they loaded trailers from large trucks on to the boat.  Next motorcycles and campers boarded, finally large cars then small cars entered.  We climbed up and internal ramp to the 5th deck of the boat (out of 10 decks total – the decks are human sized, not car sized; there may have only been 2 or 3 car decks).  Just like on the Nova Scotia ferry, they had you point out when you parked.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259673491">
<p>
I have never been on a bigger boat than the Interisland Ferry.  In the lowest floor were the cinemas and a children’s play area – I did not visit this floor.  On the 7th deck was a bar with the interior tables, a TV, an arcade, a café and several reclining-chair seating areas.  The tables for the cafeteria on the 8th floor were at the bow and had forward looking windows.  On the 10th floor was the rooftop sun (haha!) deck.  The deck only covered the center of the boat as the bow deck was reserved for the navigation electronics and the helicopter winch drop zone!  There was a 9th floor with private cabins.
</p>

<p>
After we ate in the cafeteria, we went up to the roof deck for a little while to watch the sounds pass by.  They were not as pretty as they were in the sun a few days ago.  We did notice however a number of waterside houses that had no land or road access.  People must boat to their vacation houses.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259674177">
<p>
We then moved to a glass atrium with bar tables that was accessed from the 7th floor bar.  This two story atrium had 180 degree views out the stern and was sheltered from the elements.  Katrina stayed here for much of the journey.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259675416">
<p>
The first hour was going through the South Island’s sounds, passing some tight areas, by mostly wooded hills, by vacation homes and a few floating fish farms, and finally, near the exit to the open water, seeing some dolphins and some sheep pastures.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259681071">
<p>
The Cook Strait crossing was about 22 km and also took about 1 hour.  I started feeling queasy on this portion in the rocking seas and had to lie down and close my eyes.  The last hour was entering and docking in the broad Wellington harbor/bay.  Wellington is built on coastal hills, and reminds me of San Francisco with its neighborhoods of white or light colored houses spreading across one hilltop or another.  Downtown Wellington is hidden in the most sheltered of the harbor, and has many tall buildings of 20 or 30 stories.  Wellington – like San Francisco – is on a big fault which at the end of the 1800’s shook and rose the city up by 3 meters!  This created a “perfect” waterside plateau for a new highway and railway around the bay.  Yikes!
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259684737">
<p>
The cars behind me cut, so I was actually the last car off of the ferry.  We drove along the port (past piles of logged lumber waiting for export) and into downtown Wellington.  We waited 5 minutes and several cycles at the exit traffic light before turning away from the harbor and towards the parliament “beehive” building.  The tall towers in town seem to be government, bank and oil company buildings.  We went past downtown, past the government center, past the botanical gardens and up into the hilly neighborhoods following signs for Karori.  Eventually we made it to the street where Jan, David and Rachel live.  Along the way, we passed several neighborhood centers about the size of Cole Valley.  The houses here also have San Francisco style with 2 or 3 story construction and front bay windows.  Our host’s home is off the main avenue and is nice and quiet.  The house has a street level garage, but you climb one or two flights of stairs through the flower garden (and past “Nobody” the ginger cat) to the front door.  Really, this could have been a modestly upscale house in San Francisco. 
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259707494">
<p>
The house is two main stories.  On the first floor we say the TV/sitting room, the kitchen and dining room and a small study.  On the second floor we slept in Jennifer’s (the eldest daughter, now graduated an on OE in Australia, about to land a job at a mining company in Perth) room on a water bed.  The bed was not as deep as anticipated, and it was nice how your whole back is supported without any hotspots from weight.  Still the rippling water would wake up your partner if you moved.
</p>
</span>
<p>
From 5 to 6pm we talked with David in the sitting room, discussing our travels and the family’s time in Turkey.  Jan arrived at about 6pm and we recovered some ground, also talking about Katrina and my jobs, about our family histories, and places we want to travel.  Jan and David are very nostalgic about Turkey, and they highly recommended visiting Jordan and the Middle East.  We learned that they both came from farm families, that David thinks there is no money to be made farming sheep, that NZ does not subsidize its industries or place embargoes on trade, that NZ only has 200 foreign affairs officials, that NZ has just 4 million citizens, that only recently NZ converted to the metric system, that after 2 or 3 generations New Zealanders consider themselves Kiwis and don’t trace their immigrant origins, that Kiwis have a special two-year visa exemption in England, that NZ never broke from England, that the prime minister has a 3 year term.
</p>

<p>
What else?  Jan is allergic to wine and David does not like Riesling.  Doh!
</p>

<p>
Jan and David are planning a Heaphy Track hike soon for 5 days.  They did the Abel Tasman track, but had their equipment shuttled by boat from camp to camp.  Jan is applying for a new job and is hoping to find a position in Asia.  She had worked in Bangkok in the past.  Rachel is 13 years old and she is 2” taller than Katrina.  Her summer vacation starts in two weeks.  She is a very good kid and even acted as hostess during our visit.
</p>

<p>
For dinner we ate the quiche and salad David had prepared (and burnt!), then for desert we had a raspberry yogurt with marshmallow dish that Jan made.  I had two helpings but could not finish all of the marshmallows.  The dinnertime music included Neil Young and Paul Simon records which I recognized from Henry’s collections.
</p>

<p>
It was a very fun evening.  We were particularly delighted in the humor of the cat’s name “Nobody,” which made for the funny joke “Nobody loves me.”
</p>

<p>
We went to sleep at about 10:30pm.
</p>

<span class="timestamp" id="1259740410">
<h3><a name="091202">12/2/09  Taupo</a></h3>

<p>
Rachel was gone for school before I was out of the shower.  We ate around 8:30am (toast and tea, turning down Weatbix and hearing that the imported Lucky Charms were finished), took a group photo with Jan and David and hit the road around 9:30am.  We skipped Wellington’s premiere museum to make up time on the road.  We drove highway for most of the day.  First it tracks through suburb, then through farming towns on the west coast.  We stopped at a McCafe and then in the town of Levis where I found an Auckland Warriors rugby jersey for Tucker.  This team place in the Australian Rugby League, and is not so good any more.  These west coast towns have more Maori faces than did the towns in the South Island.  Also, the birds are not stupid here, and stay out of the way of traffic.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259754627">
<p>
After the coast Hwy 1 turns inland towards Taupo.  Katrina was driving now and the dark gray rain clouds were opening up from time to time.  We when through more agricultural land and then started twisting along a river which had cut cliffs into the rock.  Katrina was getting frustrated with shifting gears when there were so many work zones, truckers expecting to be passed on hills, and queues forming behind, so I took the wheel again.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259760143">
<p>
In Taihape we stopped (1pm) for lunch at the Main St Café.  I had nachos (New Zealand imitation style with cheese flavored chips, red beans, canned tomatoes and melted cheese).  Katrina had an (almost) Greek salad.  Taihape is known for gumboots – rain galoshes – for some reason.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259762266">
<p>
Continuing on we started the highland “Desert Highway” which passes beside the volcanoes in Tongariro National Park – the home of Mordor.  The tip of the volcano Mt Ruapehu was cloud covered but the lower portions – which were stilled cloud covered – could be seen.  Most impressive is that the “desert” plains building up to the mountain is black like Mordor.  The soils are dark and volcanic, and the scrubby bushes are blackened in bark and leaf.  Maybe no color editing was needed for Lord of the Rings?  A good portion of the plain along the highway was New Zealand Army training ground.  There were plenty of off road tracks through the scrub and hills, and signs warning of explosions and live fire.  I was disappointed no tanks were training today.  We did pass one APC, but it was driving on the highway.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259765461">
<p>
The desert gives way to green rolling hills and soon we were along the shores of Lake Taupo.  This is a crater lake.  Mainly though, it is just very large.  We drove along the east side up to Taupo.  Taupo was larger than I expected, maybe the size of Queenstown.  I guess there are just more large towns on the North Island.  
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259769063">
<p>
We did not explore town but went directly to Huka Falls.  Here the emerald Waikato River funnels through a 50’ wide slice in the rock.  The channel is not so deep, but it roils the water and turns it an unbelievable they-must-have-dyed-this-river blue (aquamarine?).  The chute is full of waves and bubbling water and then pours out in a “small” waterfall that would fill two Olympic pools every second.  The river after the falls has a gradient of colors from the bubble lightening blues back to the deep emerald.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259770947">
<p>
Next we went to the Aratiatia rapids on the same river.  This section is dam controlled.  We arrived at 4:20pm when the dam was releasing water, making the 1km rapid section full of water.  At 4:30pm the gates closed and the water in the rapids dropped five feet in ten minutes.  We stood and watched this process.  I was glad we god to see this pretty colored water go through the wild rapid.  15% of New Zealand’s power comes from dams on this river.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259773192">
<p>
We went next to the Craters of the Moon thermal area.  40 years ago they screwed up when trying to build a thermal power station and accidentally created a geothermal activity region that continues to grow.  We bought tickets and walked the path through the area, careful not to stray as there were many “We are not liable for injuries” signs about.  Every which way were little vents letting off sulfur steam.  There were four larger craters steaming significantly, two with boiling mud in their bottoms.  Really this did not look like the moon at all.  Ferns and microbes were growing in the craters.  The earth was rainbow colored either from minerals or from microbes.  The path was pretty fun to face around.  At 5:30pm they turned on a siren letting us know that the park was closing soon.  At 5:45pm we were back to the car and heading on to Rotarua.
</p>
</span>
<p>
Rotarua was about 1 hour north, through more rain and green hills.  We passed a nuclear power plant, and drove through the rippled land from an eruption 125 years ago.
</p>

<p>
Our hostel is the Kiwi Paka on the edge of Rotarua.  It is cheap, but very modest, almost downright stingy.  The room has a bed and a desk and very old blankets and curtains.  The kitchen had no sharp knives and not enough dish towels.  Apparently the neighborhood is bad too!  I am not thrilled, but it is our last place.
</p>

<p>
We ate pasta with arrabiata sauce and asparagus.  The kitchen and the motel floor is teaming with high school boys who are all on some sports teams.  They were partly to blame for the lack of dish towels, as they stuffed six of the towels into the pool table pockets so that they would only have to pay once to play.  Tonight we also drank our Riesling (the one that David rejected), and then caught up in our journals.
</p>

</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259832662">
<h3><a name="091203">12/3/09  Rotarua</a></h3>

<p>
We got up earlyish (the boys sports team was awake at 6am) and did oatmeal and tea before leaving for Wai-O-Tapu thermal wonderland.  We drove south on Highway 5 for 30 minutes, and arrived at the thermal area around 9:15am.  Again, our out dated guide book left us surprised by the new entry fee of NZ $30 per person.  Because the geyser here erupts at 10”15am, there was not time to complete the hiking tour before the eruption.  We killed some time at the boiling mud pit and arrived early to the geyser.  There is a theater around the geyser cone, the closest seats are only 20’ away from the outlet.  Splash zone sighs warn that cold spray may hit you.  Kat read that they prime the geyser each morning by dropping in soap chunks.  We sat trying to guess when the actual eruption would occur – how accurate was the priming.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259835207">
<p>
At 10:15am our questions were answered because a park representative with a microphone walked out right next to the geyser and explained how prisoners on a work duty had been washing clothes in this thermal pool when one of them dropped in his soap bar and shortly after the geyser erupted.  Then they came back and surrounded the pool with rocks to funnel the eruptions and make them more spectacular.  Then the guide took out three chunks of soap bar, dropped them into the geyser cone and continued talking.  There is hot and cold water beneath the cone.  The soap disrupts the layer between the two, letting the cold water fall into the hot.  This creates steam and an eruption.  Unprovoked the geyser would spout once every 24 to 72 hours.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259835347">
<p>
The geyser first suds out soap bubbles about three minutes after the soap was added.  Slowly the flow increased, then in the span of a minute, raised from 6 inches high to 70 feet high.  The mist from the geyser was indeed cool, and sudsy too; we got sprayed.  The eruption lasts one hour; we watched maybe 30 minutes.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259835999">
<p>
We then drove back to the main body of the park and walked the paths.  First we walked along a cratered landscape with fallen sinkholes and caves.  Yellow (sulfur), orange and red stains were in the earth.  Steam vented here and there and mud boiled in the pits.  The devil’s ink pot had brown/black boiling waters because the thermal activity stirred up an oil deposit.  There was egg smell in the air, and Brussels sprouts in the craters.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259837491">
<p>
We came to the “Artist’s Palette,” a pool with yellow, green and orange bubbling sections.  The colors are muted by Yellowstone standards.  The pool is on a rise and has created a river of calcified mini-terraces going down the hill.   An adjacent hilltop pool has green waters and an orange mineral crust/ring that looks a bit link coral.  This pool steams heavily.
</p>

<p>
We walked through the woods and to the lower sections of the river fed by the artist’s palette.  There are sections of stream and boiling here too, and a large green lake looking out over the pastoral hills and passed the geothermal plant’s cooling stack.  The track looped back to the painter’s pool – by now the sun had broken the clouds and we even saw a New Zealand-shaped cloud float overhead – and returned through the crater land.  The Devil’s Bath had bright yellow water.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259843089">
<p>
Katrina egg salad and pumpkin soup, and I had a veggie wrap at the park’s cafeteria, then we left the park at about noon.  Last night I had penciled in a few stages of the Targa Rotorua 2009 into our maps, so we crossed highway 5 and did some of the Waikite Valley stages.  The first segment (#2/#4) of the Targa was on fast roads leading into increasingly tighter twists and turns.  The loop took me ~30 minutes and was quite fun at 6/10ths and within the 100kph speed limit.  The land here is egg crate shaped pasture land, forcing dips and turns into the roads.  There are some forest sections, but most of the forests seem farmed for lumber.
</p>

<p>
Parsons Road was a highlight, as was a Mangatete road with a blind crest hiding a sharp left that caught me out.  We also tried stages #1/#3 on Bryce Rd which was good and tight too.  You would have to be very ballsy to drive these roads at 10/10ths!
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259849055">
<p>
We went into town for a short bit and got avocado, humus, sprouts, tomato, aioli sandwiches at Fat Dog Café – cheap, good but not super filling.  
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259866754">
<p>
We returned to the hostel and changed into swimsuits so we could go to the Polynesian Spa.  This spa is by Lake Rotorua, and for NZ$20 we had adult pool access to seven pools of three water types and temperatures.  There were acidic and basic pools, one good for skin (alkaline) and the other good for muscles and aches (basic).  The pools were in the 90-degrees Fahrenheit at the coolest and 100 degrees (or 110 degrees?) at the hottest.  We did about two rounds of the pools, going from the big warm skin pool, to the super hot shallow ‘ache’ pool (there were three of these, one with lake views) , to the medium-hot second skin pool.  This last pool type had waterfalls between the three tiers.
</p>

<p>
After 1.5 hours at the spa, we went to the Rotorua Bath House museum.  This is a grand Elizabethan building on the lake, with broad gardens out front.  You enter into the center atrium with three story high spacious ceilings and a second floor balcony that looks down into the entry.  Symmetrical left and right wings spread out to the sides.  Originally the men bathed in the left wing and the women in the right.  The building was constructed for a 1908 opening.  Its purpose was to be a health spa for wealth clients to bathe in the volcanic spring waters and cure all kinds of ills.  The visionary doctor behind the project also loved incorporating the latest in medical technology, and gave electrifying baths and thrashing machine treatments to the patients too.  Patients would bathe 20 minutes in private tubs, 20 minutes relaxing on a table, and then have other activities in and around the grounds.
</p>

<p>
Because the spa waters put acid fumes into the air, the bathhouse paint and tail tarnished frequently, spoiling the founder’s vision of the establishment.
</p>

<p>
We watched and interactive (the seats shook) 20 minute movie about Rotorua and the 1886 Tarawera eruption that killed 120 locals and ruined the region’s premier attraction, the pink terrace pools and the white terrace pools.  This eruption ripped the mountain in half, destroyed many of the European buildings in town, even though many slopped roof Maori dwellings survived.
</p>

<p>
We took a guided museum tour covering all of what I just told, and also showing us the basement (where the pipes move spa water and where mud baths were given), plus a gallery on the 1886 eruption and another on the Maori of the area.  We learned that carved Maori houses came after the Europeans as a way of reclaiming a place of home.  The houses also have human form.  Spine – roofline, arms – roof’s edge, windows – eyes.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259867412">
<p>
After the museum, we returned to the hotel to wait for our bus pickup for the Tamaki Maori Hangi.  We were the last party to be collected, out bus was called Weka.  There was a rowdy group of rugby loving South African students.  Our bus driver taught us a few phrases like Kia hora – hello, car pie – good, and aye – yes.  This bus driver also informed us that we were on a voyage in time, back to when a powerful northern warrior was coming to Tamaki to recruit the chief’s sun, a great warrior too, to fight with him using newly acquired rifle power.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1259868516">
<p>
On arrival there was an intimidation ceremony where traditionally dressed Maori in feather capes and waist clothes approached the chiefs of each buss, making threatening gestures with their wood weapons, doing the tongue out, eye’s wide scary expression, and moving with bird-like jerkiness.  We were told not to smile, laugh or touch the warriors.
</p>

<p>
We watched shivering, wondering how cold these underdressed men were.  Finally, the chief put a leafy branch down on the ground and indicated that the visiting chief should retrieve it.  This was an acceptance/peace symbol.  The chiefs then led us through the village gates into a forested village environment.
</p>

In the sample village, there were six or more huts with different crafts being done.  A wood carver was making a hollow log to be an alarm drum.  A woman was preparing flax for making string and weaving.  Other women were peeling potatoes with sharpened oyster shells and cooking the potatoes on fire embers.  The tattoo artist was showing tattoos on the chief and warrior.  Other warriors were doing the Haka face with tourists for pictures.

Next we were brought into a performance hall were song, dance, guitar playing and story were brought to us.  I found the use of swinging balls on ropes for creating percussion music on ones arms most interesting.  It was explained that the village was created to teach young Maori about traditions, especially those of warfare.

Finally we were brought to the dining room, where we had buffet food cooked hangi-style in a covered pit in the earth.  Even though we had preordered vegetarian meals, they had not made us any so we picked carrots, potatoes, kumara, stuffing, salads (coleslaw, pasta and plain), cranberry sauce (!) and other dressings.  This was a strangely western menu for the meal.  The dinner food was decent; all had the earthy flavor cooked in.  For desert there was a bread/pudding also cooked in the hangi, which we put custard sauce over.  There was a parawaka meringue pie with three types of meringue.  The meal service was fine, but clearly not the central activity the way the roast is in a luau.  Oh, we also got jibed at by the warriors when we told them we were English.  They support Obama, as he has Polynesian roots in his history too.

On the bus ride home the driver had us sing songs from each country present.  Kat did not want to sing and I cannot carry a tune once started, so America had a poor showing.  The South Africans could, and did, go on and on though to the driver’s delight.  When the driver approached roundabout, she started singing “She’ll be coming around the mountain” and then continued rotating in the rotary until the song finished!  The second bus was in the rotary too, spinning with us!  The South Africans liked this so much that they resung the song at the next rotary to get a few more rotations out of the driver.

We went straight to bed, after being dropped off last.

This morning we got up at 7am, packed and finished our kiwi fruit and honey in the hostel kitchen.  I sent one short email to my admirers, and then we checked out and went to Rotorua to find a little more food.  Downtown we got a bagel, egg, potatoes, tomatoes, and mushrooms plate at a busy, hip café.  The food was good.  It was raining hard again, and I noticed that Rotorua has covered sidewalks – they must expect this weather.  I also got nasal spray and a gift tie with sheep for Louis.

The drive to the airport was about 3 hours.  We took the highway through Cambridge, around Hamilton (it felt like a back road had been given a highway number) and stopped in Bombay for lunch on the highway.  We ate in an Asian noodle shop.  It was less than 1 hour to Auckland International Airport, where we dropped off the Focus at Apex rentals.  We put about 3,000km on the car in 10 days.  I like the European Focus; it is more comfortable and sporty than my Mazda3, and just as capable.  The only shame is that it takes premium and that the pedals are too tight for my size 14 shoes.

At the Qantas check-in the agent was unable (unwilling?) to give us boarding passes for the LAX to ORD and ORD to BOS legs of our trip.  She wanted to see a printed itinerary, and was unwilling to accept Katrina’s handwritten copy of the itinerary (we only go the email from Stan a few days ago) as evidence that everything was in order.  Also, our US flights are not etickets, which added to the difficulty.  We gave up and accepted that we will recheck in at the LAX transfer desk.
</p>

<p>
We browsed the Duty Free shop but did not buy anything.  I did get Kat swirl earrings at another shop.
</p>

<p>
We had a 10:50am flight on a 747 to LA.  The plane’s on demand movie system was on the fritz and had to be restarted 2 times.  I did get to finish Harry Potter, watch all of UP and The Brothers Bloom.  We had vegan meals which I thought were decent, but which Kat did not eat.  I may have slept 1 or 2 hours.
</p>

<p>
We landed in LA as the sun was rising and the sky was deep orange.  We cleared customs quickly but had to transfer by bus to United’s terminal.  We rechecked in, stressing over if we should try for a non-stop flight – we didn’t.  While trying to recheck our bags but got blocked when the airline learned Kat has a wine bottle in her bag.  We were force to pay $10 for a box for the $15 wine so we could check the bag; Katrina swears she will never bring alcohol home again.  Finally, we waited through security and found our flight.
</p>

<p>
Next time let’s go through SFO where you don’t need to take a bus to transfer terminals.
</p>

<p>
I got breakfast of scrambled egg pizza at Wolfgang Puck’s.  Kat called Bank of America to find out why her ATM card is not working and was told that because of a data breach at the bank the card number was cancelled the day we left the USA!
</p>

<p>
I slept on the flight to Chicago, though I did watch the LA basin disappear out of the windows first.  It looks so dry and exotic!
</p>

<p>
Amazingly, the sun was setting at 3:30pm as we came into ORD.  I listened in on the Air Traffic Control radio – this is a busy system!  We ended up flying 5 minutes out over Lake Michigan before doubling back and landing.  There were good sunset city views from the window.
</p>

<p>
We got salads in ORD and boarded the 5 pm flight.  It is dark, cold (23*F) and there are small snow plots evident.   The news stand seems pretty grim on the economy, something not really felt overseas.  Also, everything feels so work, work, go, go oriented.  It might take me a little while to get over culture shock and get moving myself.

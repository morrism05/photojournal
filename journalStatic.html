<h3>Oct 19-20, 2009</h3>

<p>
We got an early flight to Chicago, then connected to a JAL flight to Tokyo.  In Boston Logan, Kat bought maple syrup and “Boston” labeled chocolate bars as token gifts for Japanese hosts.
</p>
<p>
The Tokyo plane ride was 12.5 hours, just 1 hour more than the EWR->HNL flight we did one year ago.  I don’t know if I actually slept, but I had my eyes closed for 4 or 5 hours on the plane.  I also watched 3 movies, one “Summer Wars” was anime and was about a math Olympics kid that defeats an Army AI that is taking over Japan’s main internet service.  The food on the plane was two meals of mini fruit and green salads; the entrée was rice and mixed veggies.  Edible but not inspired.
</p>
<p>
Customs was straight forward and quick.  They did have IR video cameras looking for sick people with fevers.
</p>
<p>
We went looking for the phone rental shop SoftBank to get our rental cell phone.  On the way Kat dropped the bag of gifts – I brought “Mikes” pastries for Eric – and the maple syrup container broke.  Kat ended up covering one pant leg in syrup!  We got our phone, got cash, and then Kat realized that her cell phone was missing!  JAL was able to locate it quickly on the plane and return it to us.  Then we picked up our JR Rail passes and got on the airport Narita Express train to Tokyo station (a 1 hr trip), connected to the Yamamoto line to Nippori Station, and then a Joban line to Minami-Senju station.
</p>
<p>
The trains and stations are all orderly, logical, and efficient and have plenty of English signage to help us along.  The logic of the system makes the trains much less intimidating then was Moscow’s system.  In face, all of Japan seems more predictable and less scary than Russia.
</p>
<p>
-- Oh we also saw bamboo grove from the airport express.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1255972933">
<p>
From Minami-senju station, it was a ten minute walk to Kangaroo Hotel.  The hotel is all concrete, a bit like a barracks, but has friendly touches to make it more inviting.  Our room was largely filled with the futon mats, but also had a TV, fridge, and AC.  It was located in a quite street.  We had one set of slippers (size 7?) for the hotel, and others for the toilets.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1255980300">
<p>
Eric told us to meet him at Shinjuku Station at 8pm for dinner.  We got there early and people watched while waiting.  70% of the men dress in business suits – dark and often with pinstripes.  The women (especially the younger ones) wear much wider and wilder style of clothes.  They are mainly in skirts, but some are lacey, others plain, others have bright prints.  The most eye catching were two girls in pink puffy, Alice-in-Wonderland dresses with fairy-tale character patches stitched onto the fabric.  Kat called them “cupcakes.”  Another girl had sheet-music socks and a keyboard tie!  The ‘cool’ guys here have punk/pop style haircuts and logo t-shirts.
</p>
<p>
Eric was the 6th western person to be spotted and he took us out to the street. Big 10-story buildings were all lit up with neon lights advertising the various stores on each floor.  It was busy like Las Ramblas, lit like Vegas and very exciting.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256023915">
<p>
We ended up choosing an Onokomaki (spelling?) place where your table is a griddle and you order a bowl of batter + mochi or leeks + egg to stir and grill.  You gook it yourself!  We also had sake, which was poured into your glass until it overflowed onto the saucer, an expression of generosity and prosperity.  The griddle cake was decent, eaten with a sweet brown sauce on top.  Eric seems well, if scruffy and overworked.
</p>
<p>
After dinner Eric took us to a Toyobashi electronics store to buy a PS3.  The store probably has the square-footage of a Best Buy, but is chunked up over 6 floors.  The ceilings are lower and very brightly lighted, the store packed with electronics, games, etc.
</p>
<p>
On the trains we have been seeing many people playing Gameboys or cell phone games.  It is more popular here.  People have been checking us out on the trains, but we really don’t get that many looks.  I am mainly surprised by how homogeneous the population is – maybe I just don’t recognize the different Asian builds?  Or are they really all Japanese people?  We see white tourists every so often and black ones only twice.
</p>
<p>
After leaving Eric, we took showers at the hotel, washed our dirtiest clothes and went to sleep.
</p>
<p>
PS – we forgot to give Eric his gift!  Also, I saw two GT-Rs so far.
</p>

</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256107631">
<h3>10-21-09</h3>
<p>
We only slept until 6am (sunrise?).  All of the bird song is unfamiliar.  Like yesterday, today is warm; t-shirt weather!  Kat and I packed up and then headed out early for our Kyoto train.  We hit rush hour again, but our trains where boardable.  
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256110003">
<p>On one train we were able to watch the engineer.  He was in a uniform with white gloves and he had a pocket round, old-style watch placed in a special receptacle in the dash board.  At each station he would point his hand at the “go” light on the dash, then at the speed for the next rail segment, seemingly trying to anticipate when and which lights would appear.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256111271">
<p>
At Tokyo Station we exchanged our 10:30am rail pass for an 8:30 train Shinkansen Super Express to Kyoto.  We had middle seats booked on the left, but Kat had the good idea of boarding a non-reserved car and finding Mt Fuji side seats.  In the station I looked around for food and found egg salad sandwiches – white bread, no crust – and mochi adzuki sweet buns.  There were lots of bento boxes, but none that looked vegetarian.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256116892">
<p>
On the train haze kept us from seeing lots of Fuji, but Fuji was visible for maybe 20 minutes above the clouds.  Fuji has a very smooth and distinct profile, and has surprisingly little snow at this time of year!
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256118029">
<p>
Japan seems to be either flat or mountainous, and wherever it is flat is it fully developed.  The mountains on the other hand are not used at all.  In the flat we say dense population, scattered farming of crops – not animals – tea farms, orange fruit farms that are probably persimmons (we tried one later, it is good), city or factory, driving ranges.  We passed factories for Sony, Panasonic and a few other brands I recognized.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256126549">
<p>
It was maybe 2hrs to Kyoto, and then 3 stops north on the subway to Hotel Hearton.  We dropped off our packs at the front desk and then walked to the #17 bust stop by city hall.  At the bus stop there was an automated sign that indicated which buses were within 2 stops of arriving – very cool!
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256128734">
<p>
We took the bus to near Ginkaku-ji temple and then walked up to the temple.  Most impressive were the gardens.  The grounds are so well kept, with moss ground-cover and spaced trees.  We watched the gardeners sweep the moss clean and carry away fallen leaves.  The temple also has shaped stone/gravel gardens, forming cones and shaping stripes.  It is all perfectly precise.  The silver temple itself was under construction and only the 2nd floor was fully intact.  Still, from the hillside walking paths the temple roofs look nice.
</p>
<p>
I think Japanese gardens and especially the one at Ginkanku-ji really are my favorite type of garden.  I am not sure why!  The spacing, the water features, the enticing paths – I just like it!
</p>
<p>
Also in Ginkanku-ji we say a few Kimonoed people. Wearing kimono is more common in Kyoto than in Tokyo.  In general Kyoto dress is more causal than Tokyo – I am reminded of SF vs NYC.  The density and surrounding landscape also fits the SF vs NYC comparison.  
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256131847">
<p>
We then walked south along the Philosopher’s Path – a series of roads along a canal.  There are plenty of interesting eateries and a number that make you think Americans and Europeans are setting up shop in Kyoto.  The houses here are nice – not super upscale but very comfortable and in a good, quiet neighborhood.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256135138">
<p>
We walked to Reikan-ji thinking that we could find a multi-course tofu meal there, but then Kat remembered the tofu was actually by Nomura Museum and Tenju-an.  We found the place and sat in a traditional matted room, with open sliding rice-paper walls, looking at a pretty green garden.  The building looked old and crafted by skilled workmen.  Our waitress, in traditional dress, brought us sesame tofu, yam soup/porridge, tofu grilled with green sauce, tofu in hot water with seasonings, pickled veggies, rice, tempura including a tempura backed leaf, and tea.  My favorites were the green sauce tofu and the water tofu.  The waitress was kind enough to tell us what to eat and what to drink (yam stew).  It was a pleasant meal in a beautiful atmosphere.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256138529">
<p>
Next we back-tracked to Eikan-do and toured this large and still functioning complex.  The highlight here was the temple interiors, painted in bright colors, with geometric forms, nature scenes (waves or fire), or animals and mythical figures.  This temple is best known for its autumn colors, but we are just a bit too early to see more than a handful of red leaves.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256142361">
<p>
We continued south past Chion-an and Maruyama-koen to about Kodai-ji.  The neighborhood turned upscale with nicer restaurants and hotels, just across from Kodai-ji we walked back streets – “the prettiest in Kyoto” – filled with stone walls, old wood construction and waist high bamboo fencing,
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256145714">
<p>
We then went up to Gion and Shinbashi where we walked through the love district and along a pretty canal lined with private dining rooms.  Night had fallen (~6pm) and each restaurant had its own lighting to illuminate the water and better the view for customers.
</p>
<p>
The love district is not racy from the outside, but there are plenty of signs verbally offering girl bar this and companion that.  It was on the other side of the river near Pontacho where we say “Skank Disco” and more forward sex video options.  None of this is too racy to walk a child by though.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256149923">
<p>
Finally we walked through the Sanjo covered arcade and back to the hotel.  Here we cleaned-up, ogled the previews for the 500 yen pornos, ate our orange fruit and the convenience store sake, then retired.
</p>
<p>
Kyoto is a comfortable and interesting city!  We must have seen five distinct styles of neighborhood, three or four restaurants with veggie food and a gazillion temples today!  There is so much we could see here, but we will be gone before we know it.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256198704">
<h3>10-22-09</h3>
<p>
We got an early start, grabbed adzuki pastery and yogurt from a combini on the run and took the bus to Ryoan-ju and its rock zen garden.  We were some of the first on the premises and enjoyed the rocks with about three other western tourists.  Mainly I thought about how to rake the garden so as not to leave any footprints and I noticed how the rocks were like islands in the sea – perhaps it took an islander’s mentality to come up with such a garden?
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256203165">
<p>
Next we walked over to Kinkaku-ju, which was packed even though it was only 9:15am.  The highlight here is the Golden Temple on the edge of a beautiful lake.  We could not enter the temple but saw pictures of its interior and its reflective (pool-like) floors!  We had a student (here were many schools visiting) take a picture of us giving the peace sign like all the cool (Japanese) kids do.  Also on the grounds were some concession stands giving tastes of treats.  I had mochi green tea balls and fruit-filled mochi ravioli that were both very good.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256208400">
<p>
We bussed it down to the imperial gardens where the Costumes of the Ages parade was about to start.  Some kind elderly ladies gave us their front row tickets – the sun was too hot for them.  Our seats where on blankets rolled out on the gravel street.  The Japanese would remove their shoes before walking on to the mats.  We watched the parade close up.  There were lots of swords and beaded armor.  Some troupes did dance routines and passed tall polls back and forth.  Others pushed carriages by.  I could not tell one era’s costumes from the next, and grew bored.  We left after an hour.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256218687">
<p>
For lunch we ate at Biote, a five table 2nd floor establishment with whole foods focus and a veggie menu.  We got our first miso soup of the trip and generally enjoyed the food!  It kinda reminded me of Veggie Planet for its scrappy tables and small dining area.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256221434">
<p>
Next we walked to Nishikakoji-dori food market.  There were lots more mochi foods, rice cakes, fish dried and fresh, pickles, fruit, and candy to be seen.  We sampled the free tastes, but only Kat bought a rice cake.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256225691">
<p>
We took the trains to the north to see the Kurama Fire Festival.  We got off one station earlier than Kurama as the guide book mentioned that you could walk to the “impossibly quaint” Kibune (20 min) and then hike over the mountain to the temples above Kurama (30 min).  Unfortunately, it was more like 35 min to Kibune and I was worried our light would fade before we reached Kurama.  Our map was not the clearest, the signage was only in Japanese and there were multiple paths through the forest.  The smart/safe move would have been to turn around and get back on the train, but Kat was already on edge for getting bad information from the guide book and for my worrying about the sunset.  Hikers coming down the Kibune-Kurama woods trail suggested we needed 1 hour to complete the hike, and we only had 40 minutes of good light left.  For all the wrong reasons we went for it anyway, climbed the steep mountain side .8km, then descended into Kurama’s temples.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256231289">
<p>
Actually, watching the mountain sunset from the highest temple complex was very beautiful.  There are serious hills around here!  The temple altar was dark, but punctuated by lanterns that made it look starry.  The walk down the stairs from the temple was lined with lit rice lanterns, and we passed a massively thick redwood tree too!
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256233413">
<p>
In Kurama, we were confused about were the action was, and burnt 30 min at the fire source cul-de-sac, which was not on the parade route.  When we decided to leave, we were funneled into a flow of people walking up the main road and away from the trains!  In the road, parading children and adults were carrying large lit torch bundles and chanting.  Some of the torches were as large as people; we think even bigger ones would be lit later in the night.  We did not really follow the ceremony.  Some young men wore loin cloths showing off their butts.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256246673">
<p>
After enduring a thick return line to the train, we returned to Kyoto, ate Indian food for dinner at a place next to a Red Sox bar, bumped into some Americans in the restaurant, and finally retired. 
</p>

</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256286314">
<h3>10/23/09</h3>
<p>
We tried the breakfast buffet – a mix of western foods like eggs and cornflakes plus miso soup, rice and veggies – then got on the slow train (76 minutes vs 45 minutes) to Nara.  The pedestrian drag to Nara’s park complex is much more run-down/haphazard than anything else we have seen so far.  We entered the park by the 5-story pagoda, and then walked over to Tojidai, the world’s largest wood building and home to a huge Buddha statue!  Along the way we passed throngs of Japanese school groups of all ages, each group in its particular costume usually with matching hats, and we also saw our first of the 100 Nara deer.  <editorial>There were probably many more deer than that! </editorial>
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256293336">
<p>
The deer can be fed 150 yen cookies sold by venders.  We watched others buy these cookies and get the deer to chase them around looking for a treat.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256294492">
<p>
More on the school kids – we say kindergarteners to high schoolers.  The kinders wore bright hats, matching shirts and shorts, and walked in two lanes, one for boys and the other for girls, holding hands.  The bright outfits continued until middle school, when the kids would transition into suits and skirts.  Boys would all either be in Eastern suits or Western suits, some times in dark slacks and white shirts instead.  Girls wear dark sweaters over light blouses.  Their skirts are often knee length dark plaid, sometimes hiked up to mini-skirt cut.  I think these skirts are like catholic school skirts.  Additionally the girls have long dark blue socks.  They personalize the socks by embroidering a small icon on the top.  The Playboy Bunny icon seems most usual!  <editorial>Some times a school group would be a sports team, and all of the students would be in their sports uniforms. </editorial>
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256294864">
<p>
In Todai-ji there are three buddhas.  The huge central one is golden and ringed with mini-buddhas in a halo like form.  The two flanking buddhas are 60% of the main one’s size.  Also inside is the statue of a furious looking warrior.  <editorial>He had similar form to the furious warriors that typically guard the gates to temples.  These warriors are built into the gatehouse on either side of the entrance.  Todai-ji had a pair too as you entered the enclosure wall of the temple area. </editorial>
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256296117">
<p>
We watched school school girls pushing themselves through the peg hole in the bottom of a large support pillar, then pausing half way through to make peace signs and have their pictures taken by friends on the exit side.  <editorial>Passing through this peg hole in the Todai-ji temple is supposed to be like passing through the nostril in the large Buddha.  If you make it through, you get a form of good luck. </editorial>
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256297547">
<p>
Next we walked a loop through the park.  We went up towards the Kasauba Taisha shrine, which has hundreds of lanterns around on the sides of the walkways.  The lanterns are sometimes three rows deep!  This all was in the forest – I may have seen Japanese redwoods – and was very beautiful.  <editorial>In the shrine, we paused to watch some sort of formal ceremony.  The participants were in formal dress and I wondered if it might be a wedding. </editorial>  We continued south to find the Isui-en gardens.  Along the way we stopped to buy a yam from the yam vender-lady.  These ladies have wood fired yam carts to cook the yams.  It was pricy!  Yams are sold by weight and our cost almost 8000 yen!  The yam was closer to potato in consistency and sweetness than it was to sweet potatoes I am familiar with.  
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256302050">
<p>
<editorial>Upon approaching the Isui-en gardens we got confused because there were two garden entrances side by side.  The closer garden turned out not to be Isui-en, but it was free to tourists so we looked around.  It was pretty by a bit wild for Japanese standards, with the grass patchy and the woods unmanicured. </editorial>
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256302929">
<p>
The real Isui-en gardens are very beautiful; the first side has a public teahouse/eatery looking over a smaller densely foliaged pond.  <editorial>The thickness of growth on this side made feel wilder. </editorial>  The second side has a larger, more open pond, with a Windows XP-esque grassy hill on one bank, a small waterwheel, stepping stone rocks to get to an island in the pond, tow small tea houses on the other shore.  This was all exceedingly beautiful, and I took many photos.  <editorial>Even though this garden is in the city center, it was constructed so that the foliage and walls block out all sight of the surrounding buildings, and the vantage points that remain to areas outside the garden walls only show the natural hilly landscapes on the city’s edge.  This makes the garden feel like it is in the country, not the city. </editorial>
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256305581">
<p>
Our last Nara visit was to an old house in a residential neighborhood.  The first floor was low ceilings and matted floors, the second floor had vaulted ceilings and hardwood floors.  It was nice and more spacious than I expected.
</p>

<p>
We took the train back to Kyoto, scrambled to get our bags from the hotel and then returned to the train station.  We boarded the first Shenkansen to Nagoya, arrived at Nagoya and then started looking for a connecting train to Takayama.  <editorial>We had been in contact with Eric during the day, and expected we would arrive in Takayama after him.</editorial>  As we were asking the station staff for directions, we saw Eric looking for the ticket line too!
</p>

<p>
All three of us made it onto the same train to Takayama, which left moments after we boarded.  We presented Eric with his tired and overdue Mike’s pastries.  On the ride Eric and I talked over my questions about Japan.  <editorial>Our train left after 8pm, so it was dark the whole way and we could not see the mountains we were climbing through.</editorial> 
</p>

<p>
In Takayama, we checked into our temple – which is much more like a hostel and is teaming with English speaking tourists.  Our room is a Japanese-style room with three futons on a mat floor.  The room is on the garden hallway that overlooks a small Japanese garden and pond.
</p>

<p>
Dinner was at a nearby Japanese bar.  The establishment had an English menu and extensive letters of recommendation from previous visitors.  Inside it was a three table establishment manned only by the cook.  Kat and I ordered veggie tempura and a roasted eggplant with miso sauce.  The eggplant was very good and was eaten by chopsticking the meat out of the center.  <editorial>In fact, this eggplant would become my favorite Japanese meal of the trip!</editorial>
</p>

<p>
Back at the temple, Eric showed us how to use the butane heater to warm the room.  The heater stinks!  We ended up just using the electric blankets instead.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256371602">
<h3>10/24/09</h3>

<p>
We woke up before 7:30am, took showers and then crossed the street to the coffee house for breakfast.  We almost did not enter the shop because of all the smoking inside, but one of the patrons cleared a space for us at his table so we felt obligated.  The southern wall of the place was a counter where the hostess/cook worked and where a few people could eat, the northern wall had 3 or 4 tables for patrons.  The western wall was a bookshelf of manga!
</p>

<p>
The customers were all men, all over 50, and most smoking and reading manga.  One man might have been reading a porn magazine!  (Eric says that porn here has to blur out the loins, but that he has seen men reading porn and masturbating on the subway!) Kat and I ordered egg sandwiches which were very good.  They were toast with mayo, lettuce, eggs and cucumbers.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256379905">
<p>
The car rental was just a few blocks away, and we got the Mazda Demio just after 9:15am.  Here in Japan many of the car manufactures also run rental outlets.  Since we did not remember which of the villages we wanted to see, Kat and I returned to the temple for a Google search while Eric bought a map.  We determined we wanted to see Ogimachi, Ainokura and Sugunuma, three villages known for their wood construction house with straw roofs of 1 meter thickness.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256382664">
<p>
After some mis-starts and wrong turns we made to the Sheregawago stop off the expressway.  <editorial>Here we toured a reproduction of the famous wood and straw houses, and looked over their huge selection of gift foods.</editorial>  Eric introduced us to corn on the cob with a salty Japanese sauce.  The closest village was Ogimachi.  We went up to a hillside overlook and looked down on the town.  Then entered Ogimachi and we walked among the houses, which are interspersed between rice and veggie fields.  All of the mountains in the area are in full fall color, mostly showing oranges and yellows.  The mountains are quite tall and remind me of the Alps for their steepness, though not height.  There were some many tourists in town that it was a bit of a zoo, but we toured a traditional house.  The house was five stories high!  And it was smoky all the way through from its open hearth cooking fire.  The house owner said the smoke actually cures the straw roof and helps it last an extra 10 years!  In the house we also saw silkworm farming tools.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256391216">
<p>
We ate lunch at a soba noodle shop that makes its own noodles fresh.  Then we toured the rest of the town, admiring the rainbow trout in the street side gutters, trying grilled mochi balls.  Eric went food/treat shopping for his workmates because he was feeling guilty for not working on the weekend of a deadline.  <editorial>However, we had made plans with him before the deadline was known, so he came along with us anyway.  The treat shops that he was exploring were very numerous, and had local variety food items that you might not be able to find in other towns.</editorial>  
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256397501">
<p>
We then went north to the other villages, which were much smaller and less mobbed.  Ainokusa was nestled into the mountains.  The highway to Ainokusa was a twisty line strung along a dammed canyon.  I got to drive the canyon and enjoyed the scenery and the car’s ride, even if the Mazda’s steering was not as precise as I had hoped.  <editorial> Ainokusa itself was much smaller than Ogimachi, with only one quarter of the houses and just one main street.  It was on a hillside rather than in a river valley like Ogimachi.</editorial>
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256404485">
<p>
We drove back to Takayama, and Eric tried to find a 7-11 so he could get cash.  Alas, there are no 7-11s in town!  For dinner we ate stir fried veggies at a Chinese restaurant.  Eric said his pork subuta was the best he had ever had.  Our food was just good.
</p>

<p>
Back at the temple, we all tried the pitch dark passage under the alter, trying to find the “key” to enlightenment.  Strangely the key is actually a lock!  Go figure…
</p>

<p>
Mazda Demio driving impressions!  Driving right-hand drive isn’t terribly hard, though at first I was tempted to put the far left side of the car into the ditch, just to be sure I was on the left side of the road.  Once I was on the big roads I could overcome that issue.  I did not make any mistaken turns into oncoming traffic, though each intersection required more attention.  The most different aspect was the mirror placement.  I am not used to glancing up and left for the rear-view mirror.  As such, I often felt like I was driving without rear vision.
</p>

<p>
Alas, I did not get to attack the spaghetti  roads through the mountains.  The roads we were on have low posted speed limits, and the locals seem to drive 30kph over the limits.
</p>

<p>
Cars spotted today: a new GT-R, Evo X, Evo IX, Civic Type-R, 911 Turbo, 993, several STIs.

<h3>10/25/09</h3>

<p>
Today we started by stopping at the station to book tickets back to Tokyo (via Nagoya).  We got a 12:40 train which gave us time to explore Takayama before departing.  Being cash conscious as Eric was out of money and we were running low, we ate breakfast in a coffee house near to the train station.  The coffee house was again filled with Japanese customers, and had three tables plus counter service.  On the walls were squid puppets, a stuffed animal Kitty Kat, and paintings of horses.  I ordered an “eggo toasto” which turned out to be egg salad this time around.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256463974">
<p>
After breakfast we walked over to the riverside street market.  People were selling crafts and food; we sampled sesame brittle, mochi chunks and rice crackers.  I bought some chili spices <editorial>for Mom</editorial> - we have seen chili peppers growing in this area.  There were also nice wood crafts and textiles on display.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256465948">
<p>
We left the market and headed for the old house district.  Kat and I toured a house while Eric waited outside.  The house was large, with six or seven rooms on the ground floor and maybe five rooms upstairs.  It, like many other places we have seen, had an interior garden that could be looked from the house’s core corridor that connected the rooms.  <editorial>This is the same setup that our temple lodging has.</editorial>  The house was built in 1860 and used both glass and rice paper windows.  It had an open hearth kitchen in the tall, two-story roof section of the house.  After the self-guided tour, we were given tea and a rice cracker.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256468210">
<p>
We continued on with Eric to a nearby temple.  In the temple plaza was a flower show with bonsai trees.  Also near the temple was a rock shrine with two characters on its face.  Eric surmised that if you trace those characters with a pen or brush then leave the pen at the shrine, you will have increased study ability.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256469509">
<p>
We started walking back to the temple lodge via some of the more picturesque streets of Takayama.  These streets had traditional wood faced and paper windowed stores.  They were separated from the street by oversized, deep gutters carrying flowing water.  Some stores were restaurants, but most sold food and other gifts.  After leaving the shopping district, I say a new GT-R parked in someone’s driveway – houses in this area must be more expensive than they appear!
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256475019">
<p>
This time on the train to Nagoya we had daylight and could enjoy the scenery.  The trip was two and a half hours long, with almost two hours spent descending out of the mountains.  We started by going though a few broad valleys filled with farms, homes and rice fields.  Then we ended up following a steep river gorge.  The water had that alpine blue-green color, and had cut a deep valley into the rocky earth.  We got the feeling that Japan is making the most of its water, as the rivers are dammed again and over again, and the river water feed the ever present rice fields and veggie gardens.
</p>

<p>
On the way down I also spotted two red nosed baboons dashing along the side of the highway!  <editorial>Eric says people mainly think of the monkeys as pests.</editorial>
</p>

<p>
The mountains got steeper as we descended, and started looking like those that appear on Japanese screen art surrounded by clouds.  I cannot imagine any army passing through these mountains prior to roads.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256481989">
<p>
Down in the valley near Gifu, we left the mountains behind for urban sprawl.  We still saw lots of rice farms, some yet to be harvested.  It occurred to me that this farm/city mix is a realization of an idea that is so popular in the US today, local food.  We also say a few cows, the first livestock we have spotted on this trip.  
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256483172">
<p>
In Nagoya I was surprised by the raciness of the women.  We exited the train station so Eric could get cash at a 7-11, then walked to the huge 13 story department store attached to the station to find food.  Walking to the department store, we accosted a Japanese kid with a Dartmouth hat.  He clearly had never been to our school.  The department store was floor after floor of expensive shopping topped by two floors of restaurants.  We tried the cheaper Indian restaurant that had a veggie lunch menu.  Eric and I ordered off the “lady’s” menu!  The food was just ok – hot without flavor.  The checkout girl spoke English and when she learned that Katrina attends Harvard she was very impressed and said, “you must be very smart!”
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256487585">
<p>
We caught the return train to Tokyo.  On the train an Italian family was trying to work out with some Japanese women whose seats where whose.  I was able to use a few words of Italian to help explain, while Eric worked the Japanese end.
</p>

<p>
Eric disembarked before us and we bid him farewell.  Maybe we will meet him for dinner later this week.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256497411">
<p>
We found our hotel “Rose Garden” near Shinjuku station, then washed all of our accumulated dirty laundry and took showers.  For dinner we stopped in the 7-11 and got a soba bowl, a rice sushi, some pickles, rice crackers and Kit Kats.  <editorial>Eric has a friend that swears Japanese Kit Kats are better than those in the rest of the world.</editorial>  Apparently eating at 7-11 is how Eric survives in Tokyo without cooking, and also how many Japanese Tokyo residents eat too.  The checkout boy here at 7-11 was very helpful and even microwaved our soba dish before we left.  Overall the meal was tastier than lunch!
</p>

<p>
Here are some small things I have noticed about Japan.  Bathrooms here do not have hand towels.  The seats on the trains can rotate to face the other direction.  Train platforms have markings for each train door and you line up for a particular door before the train arrives.  Porno magna magazines are sold out in the open at 7-11.  Upscale toilets include seat warming.  Only Japanese children stare at us.  Even non-tea shops give out tea to potential customers.  There are a lot more gift shops with regional gifts that in the US.  Manhole covers are specialized per city.  Even Q-Tips have individual wrapping.  You get hot washcloths before each meal.  Only soft serve ice cream stores abound, and most stores serve green tea ice cream.  There are heating shelves for drinks better served hot in “combini” like 7-11.  Further, ice tea tastes just like tea, and is not sweetened.  In the JR rail station platform, they play 20 second jingles whenever a train arrives.  The stations also play bird song – perhaps it is a distress call to scare away the birds?  Many Tokyoers look tired.  No tipping is required anywhere!  Lots of people wear surgical masks.
</p>

</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256539652">
<h3>10/26/09</h3>

<p>
We got up at 5am to go to the Tokyo Fish Market.  Our 6:30am arrival was after the biggest bustle of the day, but there was still plenty of fish to see.  The largest fish were frozen tuna (I think) that were as big as our backpacking packs!  The fish merchants were using band saws to cut the frozen tuna into smaller pieces.
</p>

<p>
The market was not as I had imagined.  I though it would be like a farmer’s market, where each vendor had a long, slanted stand covered in ice with nice cuts of fish presented.  Instead, there were rows and rows of stacked Styrofoam boxes, each packed with fish and ice.  Some venders had their fish/crabs/mollusks/squid/turtles live in tanks or buckets of water.  Kat and I were both most moved by the live turtles, and wanted to purchase them and set them free.  The eels and other wormlike fish were the grossest, though I also had a bit of a hard time with the venders slaughtering the live fish.
</p>

<p>
The market was in a big warehouse.  We walked down one row from one end to the other and probably passed 100 venders.  In total there may have been 10 or 20 rows of this length!
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256543473">
<p>
Next we headed to the Tokyo Auto Show.  We were there at 9am, one hour early, and spent most of the time waiting in line talking with the security guard (masayuki.omori from gmail) for my ticket window.  The guard had lived in New Hampshire for 10 years, went to Southern NH University, and clearly missed the USA.
</p>

<p>
When the car show opened, I was the first in line for my ticket window.  I got inside and literally ran to the far right hand corner of the convention center, where the test drives line was located, hoping to get a drive in the Nissan GT-R.  <editorial>I was not the only one with this hope, dozens of other young men were also running of for the line.  When I arrived I was maybe 50th in line.</editorial>  Alas, a screener turned me away from the test drive line because I don’t understand Japanese.  
</p>

<p>
Instead we looked at the cars on the floor.  The most interesting were the Honda CR-Z, the Toyota FT-86 and the Lexus LF-A.  I also saw a Lamborghini Gallardo Valentino Balboni special edition.  Katrina’s favorite car was a Mazda concept car with flowing, windy styling.  We were both amused by the Toyota string quartet playing electric violins and basses.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256565327">
<p>
Katrina and I had hoped to buy Mitsubishi hats as gifts, so we asked the Mitsubishi booth representatives were we could find hats for sale. We were sent to Mitsubishi Motors headquarters in downtown Tokyo.  While the hats they had on hand were uninspiring <editorial>- I just wanted a simple hat with the propeller symbol, not a bunch of sponsorship writing - </editorial> we did find some $15 shirts that we liked.  I started trying it on and the sales woman kindly brought over a mirror so I could see how it looked on me.  Then a senior salesman came by and asked us if the shirts cost too much.  Considering that everything else in the store was in the $40 to $120 range, I (smoothly – not!) replied no, then reconsidered and asked him if he could reduce the price.  He said how about $10 per shirt.  Then, without prodding decided to sell us the two shirts for $10 total!  <editorial>I will keep one for myself as a souvenir and the other will be given to Katrina’s brother Alex.</editorial>  Next he offered me a test drive of the MiEV.  I took him up on it and we went around the block (all lefts) in the steady typhoon rain of the day.  The MiEV is <editorial>a very narrow city car that fits 4 or 5 people and is </editorial> actually a nice drive.  My only gripe is that the brakes could stop quicker at the top of the stroke.  Mitsubishi claims a 100 mile range to this electric car.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256570258">
<p>
We went to Harajuku to find lunch at Momonoki, an organic restaurant.  <editorial>We had a bit of difficulty locating the entry to the basement restaurant, but we eventually did find it.</editorial>  The restaurant was playing classical music and had a dark atmosphere <editorial>with most of the low tables slung along the longest wall of the place.</editorial>  The menu was an extensive list of vegetable and tofu dishes.  I ordered udon with seven types of vegetables – this meant that I had a plate with two bites each of carrots, radish, leaks, daikon radish, lotus root and two other veggies I cannot remember!  Katrina had the same seven veggies with her ginger soy tofu steak.  The food was good, though we both could have eaten more.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256572812">
<p>
We walked back through Harajuku in the heavy rain.  <editorial>Harajuku is know for the fashion trend it has spawned – gothic blacks and whites juxtaposed by fairyland frilly pinks.  The area has a bit of a Haight Street feel to it too, as there are crystal and alternative lifestyle shops around.  No drugs though…</editorial>  I tried to take pictures of the more unusually dressed girls on the street.  Some of the girls were still in school uniform, others dressed smartly, others wearing checker pattern stockings with dresses or skirts.  The shops in the this district had a lot of phony American clothing, with often nonsensical messages.  Kat and I tried looking for funny shirts as souvenirs.  I did not find any knockout shirts that I liked and Katrina found that Japanese clothing sizes are too small for her.  We passed lots of second hand clothing and plaid clothing too.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256579025">
<p>
We returned to our hotel so that Kat could change out of her sandals and skirt –she was freezing in today’s nonstop cold rain and was also getting all sorts of looks from the locals <editorial>(for her shoes?)</editorial>!
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256581969">
<p>
We then went to Akihabara, the electronics district of Tokyo.  We walked through a small section of stalls selling electrical components like resistors and capacitors.  Then we crossed the main street to the side with the big electronics stores.  Store fronts alternated between software, hardware, grabby-claw arcades where you could win towels, pillows or figurines of suggestively posed anime women!  On the second floors of some buildings were the “maid cafes” where you could be served tea and food by girls dressed as maids.  The maids were also on the street hawking their respective cafes.  <editorial>I tried to take a photograph of one of these girls, but she was clearly not interested and moved out of the way of my shot.</editorial>  We went into several electronics stores, purchased SD cards for our cameras and checked out a display of robots.  <editorial>I was disappointed that these robots were just toys for play, and not robots that could household chores and the like.</editorial>  We walked around a small arcade which had pods that emulate the cockpit of a Mech warrior.  Again, there were copious amounts of anime, anime porn and real porn in street level shops.  We saw a shop window with a display of “boy-love” <editorial>(homosexual boy love stories)</editorial> manga which Eric says is marketed to and read by Japanese girls.
</p>

<p>
I am still confused as to why Japanese girls will publicly walk around dressed like anime characters from anime porn.  I guess it is to attract the attention of boys, but it seems so gutsy to take what I see as dress for the bedroom onto the street.  I also find it hard to believe that the dress-up is just for the boys, as some of the costumes look like tea party outfits for little girls.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256588178">
<p>
For dinner we went to Ebisu.  In a shopping plaza nearby to the station, we took the elevator up to the 39th floor of a tower to look out over the cloudy, rainy city.  It looked like the nightscape from a futuristic video game, with the ever continuing towers trailing off into the night and the fog.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256589860">
<p>
We met Eric at Ebisu station and then went to Zest Mexican Cantina.  I had veggie enchiladas that were not spicy at all<editorial> - Japanese food in general is not so spicy</editorial>.  Eric told us hour after getting home on Sunday he worked until 3am!  Our waiter was French and spoke English fine, but a French waiter seemed strange for a Mexican restaurant.
</p>

</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256631530">
<h3>10/27/09</h3>

<p>
Today we started by walking around some of the Shinjuku towers and going up to the observation floors.  <editorial>We tried the closest open tower to our hotel, but we could only get views towards Mt Fuji.  We stopped in a nearby luxury hotel and asked if any of the other skyscrapers had observation floors, and were told that the dual government towers across the road were open to the public.</editorial>
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256638742">
<p>
The best views were from the South tower of the government building.  We could see clearly to Mt Fuji, which was clear except for a small bit of the east slope which had clouds.  Even though it was far away, Fuji-san was impressive in its snowcapped glory.  Some other photographers in the tower told us that we were very lucky today – they had lived in Tokyo for 15 years and had not seen clear skies to Fuji even once!  
</p>

<p>
We could also see other mountains in the far distance, ringing around greater Tokyo at a distance of maybe 40 miles away.  In between Shinjuku and the southern and western ranges of mountains was think cityscape but not many skyscrapers.  However, to the east and north the huge towers in Shibuya and other business hubs could be seen.  There are so many towers spread over a vast area, making me think that Tokyo is the largest city I have seen.  The flatness of the area has certainly helped the city borders grow. 
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256642687">
<p>
<editorial> To encourage visitors to enjoy nature, someone had created a cardboard tree trunk that you could climb into.  Inside were aromatic wood chips.  A sign on the tree told visitors “Please go inside this tree.  It smells tree and make you comfortable.”</editorial>
</p>

<p>
We had purchased postage stamps on the way to the government towers, and we mailed off a batch of postcards to family, friends and coworkers.  I tried to send a card to each coworker who is helping me out while I am away on this trip.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256645291">
<p>
We walked through Shinjuku, passed the train station and on the other side entered the Isetan department store.  Department stores in Japan are like Harrods or the Corte Ingles in Spain.  They are huge multistory buildings selling everything you could think of!  In Isetan we headed to the basement in search of a picnic lunch.  The whole floor was filled with prepared food vendors, 80% of which were Japanese foods or sweets of one type or another.  The remaining 20% was western foods like Italian and French baked goods.  Most food was very expensive, but in the end we found vegetarian bento boxes containing brown rice, white rice, cooked carrots, seaweed, sweet green beans, corn salad, tempura, mushrooms, cooked radish and yam, fried tofu, and a few other items I cannot remember!  Each item had maybe two or three bites worth of food.  The box itself was Styrofoam, two tiers high and adorned with flowery patterns.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256647494">
<p>
We took our food into Shinjuku-Gyoen Park (entrance fee required) and walked around looking for a lunch spot.  Like Central Park, in many places skyscrapers could be seen above the trees.  There were wooded areas, a string of ponds and Japanese gardens, and French gardens too which we did not visit.  Also in the park was an infestation of large 1.5” spiders which created big webs in the trees!  We saw a turtle crossing the path too.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256649294">
<p>
We picked a lunch spot in a grassy meadow far away from the spider trees and enjoyed the food in the bento boxes.  The wind kept blowing our trash across the meadow and I would have to sprint to collect it.  We also finished the Pocari Sweat drink which we had purchased based on name alone.  I think it tasted more like Airborne vitamin fizz tablets than it did like sweat.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256653661">
<p>
We left the park and took the Metro to Ginza.  We walked from the shopping towers in Ginza to the Imperial Palace Park via Hibiya Park.  Ginza was similar to the other tower filled stops in Tokyo, though things were slightly cleaner and the streets broader.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256654003">
<p>
Hibiya Park and the Imperial Palace Park were most striking for the huge fortress walls and moats that contained the parks.  The moat must have been 50’ wide, filled with water and the steeply inclined walls were straight and substantial, maybe 40’ tall and made of large cut boulders.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256655008">
<p>
The palace itself is behind additional perimeters of fortress wall and is not visible except for one small building.  This building can be seen behind two bridges crossing the inner moat, and is of Japanese style.  Looking away from the park core towards Tokyo station, one sees financial towers along broad boulevards.  In some aspect the walks of the compound and the exterior parade grounds are like the Kremlin.  The difference is that there is more space between the imperial center and the city beyond.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256656840">
<p>
We boarded the subway again and when to Asakusa, Tokyo’s old town neighborhood.  The attraction here is the Senso-ji temple.  The walkways/streets up to the temple are filled with tourist shops.  We got mango soft-serve ice cream, then fried sweet bean balls, then found some nice fabric squares that I will give to Mom.  We also visited a shrine to the raccoon dog.  The Japanese say that this prankster spirit uses his testicles to fly!
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256660553">
<p>
The Senso-ji temple gate is the oldest surviving (unreconstructed) part of the temple and is beautiful in its traditional white and red color scheme.  In the gate hangs a huge lantern and nearby to the left was a four or five story pagoda that was pretty and clean in the glow of the setting sun.  (Sunset is around 5:20pm.)  The temple itself was under renovation and could not really be seen behind the scaffolding.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256661718">
<p>
Walking back to the Metro, we checked out more of the tourist shops.  There were some beautiful fabric stores.  Katrina like the idea of giving chopsticks as gifts, but acknowledged that her family would never use them.  We tried out a shiny orange rice-flour ball and some bean paste cookies.  Neither treat was great in my opinion.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256666471">
<p>
We took the Metro to Shibuya to find the huge crosswalk that fills with people every 30 seconds.  People pour into the corners of this crossing from the train station and from four surrounding streets full of stores.  When the crosswalk light clears, people flood into the road from all directions.  We went into a 2nd story Starbucks to watch the action.
</p>

<p>
Shibuya is the most peopled section of Tokyo we have visited.  It was completely overwhelming to be in its noise and crowds.  Our guidebook spoke of a vegetarian restaurant in Shibuya, so we went looking for it.  <editorial>We walked the block it should have been in without finding it, so we then ducked in to a combini for directions.  The combini manager pulled out a thick booklet of street maps, that looked a little like a city-planners set of blueprints.  Each building on each block was outlined and numbered.  The combini manager confirmed that we were looking at the correct block, so we assume the restaurant has gone out of business.</editorial>
</p>

<p>
We ended up going into the nearby department store basement to find food for dinner.  We got mango smoothies (a Japanese large is like an American small) and salads.  We returned to our hotel to pack and sleep.  Eric had invited us out for drinks, but we were so tired from our big day that we declined his offer.  It turned out to be a good thing too, because one of the many thinks I ate this afternoon made me sick and I threw up my mango smoothie!  After, I rallied a little, packed my bag and slept.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256728405">
<h2><a name="China">China</a></h2>
<h3>10/28/09</h3>
<p>
We got up at 5:30 am to make our 6:35 am Narita Express.  At the airport we returned our rental cell phone and looked for ways to spend our last yen.  Katrina got some rice crackers and some mochi ‘ravioli’ like those that we saw in Kyoto.
</p>

<p>
As our flight taxied away from the gate, the ground crew stood in a line facing the plane.  First, they all bowed in unison.  Then, as we drove away they all waved at us until we were out of sight.  Fantastic!
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256729519">
<p>
On our flight, we crossed Japan and may have very well flown over the mountains near Takayama.  I saw to the west of the city that was probably Takayama a large reservoir and to the east many tall snowcapped mountains.  Much of the Japanese mountains are deep reed with fall color.
</p>

<p>
We crossed some water and then flew over South Korea.  There seemed to be more green-space in Korea, as opposed to the many farms that consume Japan.
</p>

<p>
Between Korea and China the cloud cover (smog?) started to thicken.  It was not until we were five minutes away from landing in Beijing that we were low enough to see the buildings on the ground.  Many of the buildings are cookie-cutter apartments.  We also crossed several highways, including one that was still under construction.
</p>

<p>
<editorial>Katrina and I were worried about being quarantined by Chinese health officials.  We had heard about health checkpoints in the airport that looked for sick travelers and locked you up in a hospital for two weeks if they thought you were ill!  We had also heard about travelers who were quarantined because their seat mate was sick on the flight into China and they may have been exposed.  While still in the air, gave us a health questionnaire to fill out asking if, during the last two weeks, we had been in contact with anyone that fevered, threw up, coughed, had diarrhea, had a runny nose or was otherwise ill.  We both lied and said we had not been near anyone with such symptoms.  Then, just to be sure I was not fevering while walking through the airport, Katrina gave me some Tylenol to take 30 minutes before landing.</editorial>
</p>

<p>
Just as the plane parked at the gate, an announcement was made that quarantine officials were coming on board and that we should remain seated in our seats.  <editorial>I felt like Katrina and I would pass muster, but many of the other travelers on the plane had been hacking up a storm throughout the whole flight.  Would be in the quarantine radius?</editorial>  Even though the announcement to remain seated was made in Chinese and English, none of the Chinese passengers stayed seated!  As far as I could see, no health officials came on board, and we were soon released into the international arrivals terminal.
</p>

<p>
The international terminal is HUGE and very open.  A single span of roof flows unpartitioned from one end of the terminal to the other, held up by widely spaced, white steel columns.  The roof rises slightly in the center of the terminal to give even more height to the building.  The length of the ceiling is accentuated the pinstripe-esque ceiling cover which is built of long parallel lines of boards.
</p>

<p>
We first went through health inspection, where we handed in our health questionnaire to masked officials.  Then we walked through two sets of fever detectors.  <editorial>In addition to the Tylenol, I was wearing a baseball cap as I noticed that head gear appeared cooler than skin onscreen.</editorial>  We then came to customs, where our passports and visas were checked.  
</p>

<p>
We boarded a tram to take us away from the international terminal and to the baggage claim.  The tram rode past a long median of grass, where some workers were busy with brooms and others were relieving themselves in public view!  The tram passed the station to a yet unfinished terminal before finally arriving at the baggage claim area and the end of the track.  We collected our bags at the carousel, and then walked through the unmanned luggage inspection area and into the hall with curb-side arrival and check in counters.
</p>

<p>
There we met Glenn, our Beijing guide.  Glenn ran us over to an HSBC ATM and then ran us out to the curb.  He soon explained that we were running everywhere because the Forbidden City closes at 5pm, and it was almost 3pm already.
</p>

<p>
From the car I observed that the Audi A6 is the limo of choice in Beijing.  Our driver took us onto the highway and soon we made it to the sixth and outermost ring road.  Beijing drivers install extra wide mirrors in their cars so they can see who is creeping into their lane from the side.  Drivers freely weave from one lane to the next, doing do slowly but assertively so that other traffic does not hit them!
</p>

<p>
Because of the dense smog – it is as thick as fog but of light, browner color and not cool at all – we could only see a city block or two in any direction.  We did drive down some avenues of tall business towers that were maybe 30 stories tall.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256743086">
<p>
Finally we made it to the north entrance of the Forbidden City.  Just north of this entrance and across the street is a hill topped with a viewing platform to let you look across the Forbidden City length.  We did not get to see this vista.  Instead we headed past the water moat, which at 50’ or 100’ in width was similar to Tokyo’s imperial moat, and to the first defensive wall of the city.  This wall rises straight up and must be 50’ thick.  Passing through it we came to a second wall, then looking left saw a limestone hill with a temple on top.  Glenn had explained to us in the car that to build the Forbidden City, there was first a 10 year effort to prepare the building materials followed by 3 years of active construction.  The limestone hill we were seeing came from the bottom of a lake and was transported to the Forbidden City.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256743581">
<p>
In this second walled space there were gardens and trees as old as 500 years.  The whole Forbidden City was teaming with tourists.  Most visitors were Chinese, but we did see some foreigners too.  We seemed to be seeing the city in reverse order, as we fought against the flow of the crowds for most of the visit.  There was much more pushing, bumping and staring than what we had experienced in Japan.
</p>

<p>
Going through a third perimeter wall, we saw the “Couples Tree,” actually pair of trees planted side by side and grown so that they met each other in the middle.  Glenn took our portrait here.  Soon we saw the wedding suite, where the married couple stays for three days after the marriage ceremony.  The suite becomes the empress’s quarters thereafter.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256744070">
<p>
All of the important buildings of the Forbidden City are aligned in a north-south row.  The emperor’s quarters are immediately to the south of the empress’s building.  The throne room is next in the north-south procession, and is followed by the hall of justice.  All of the buildings have yellow tiled roofs – yellow is the imperial color – with red columns and beams.  The largest beams are painted with geometric patterns and dragons.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256745197">
<p>
Some of the central official buildings were built on raised platforms, so you would have to climb five flights of stairs to get to their entrances.  The north-south axis of the Forbidden City is paved with a smooth, stone pathway.  When this path comes to a staircase, it splits the run of stairs in two.  The pathway turned ramp is then ornamented with intricate stone carvings of dragons.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256746154">
<p>
Glenn also showed us the large caldrons for fire fighting, and pointed out the many incense burners in the shapes of cranes or turtles – animals associated with long life.  We also stopped to see a small exhibit of armor, weapons and instruments.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256747757">
<p>
Before exiting through the south gate, we came to a river with five bridges.  The center bridge was to only be used for the emperor, bridges to its sides were for the royal family, and the outer most bridges were from officials.  If you were any lower ranked, you would have to walk to the walls on the far edge of the courtyard and cross the river as there.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256748194">
<p>
Outside of the Forbidden City’s south gate was a park and parade grounds.  Military troops were marching and practicing formations.  We walked east along the Forbidden City’s moat and found our driver waiting for us at the first main street.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256749011">
<p>
The Jinqiao Hotel was maybe two miles east of Beijing’s city center.  We checked in to room (apartment?) B1018 and were awed by the size of the room.  Our Cambridge apartment could not have been larger than this room.  B1018 had a kitchen, a washer, a living room with a computer, a bathroom and a bedroom with twin beds.
</p>

<p>
Katrina and I dressed up a little, and then headed for the taxi stand in front of the hotel.  We have already noticed that service here is not as pleasant or as friendly as it was in Japan, and that tips are again expected.  Glenn and the hotel receptionist had written us a little card with the address (58 Qianmen Dajie) of the Gongdelin vegetarian restaurant we wanted to try.  We showed this card to our taxi driver, and he took us back into the city center on a huge, divided east-west road called Qianmen Street.  We passed the central north-south axis of the city, home to Tian’men Square, the National Museum, and Mao’s mausoleum, and then went a few more long blocks west.  The driver pointed to a restaurant on the far side of the divided road and then said something in Chinese which we took to mean that was the restaurant we wanted.  At the next intersection, the taxi driver did a U-turn but then drove past the restaurant!  At the next major intersection, he turned south and stopped at the mouth of a back alley.  By gestures, he told us to go down the back alley and turn right once we made it to the first street.  Or that is at least what we think he meant!
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, this back alley did not connect to another street for almost 1km!  It was poorly lighted in many places, busy with people eating at small restaurants or eating dinner outside their houses (and in the alley).  We tried stopping in a hotel to ask where the restaurant was, but the receptionist, though helpful, did not know.  Eventually we finished our 1km trek west and turned north to refind the main boulevard.  We followed Qianmen Street east for 1km, retracing the taxi’s route.  Along the way we looked at a restaurant I thought was the one the driver had pointed to, but they were clearly serving meat.  We stopped in two more hotels and asked for directions without luck.  
</p>

<p>
Pretty soon, we had walked all the way back to where the bum taxi driver had dropped us off and left with our 18 yuan fare.  Walking the block had been scary, especially considering all the travel money Katrina and I had on our persons.  In the alley, people had been openly staring at us and they did not drop their gaze when we stared right back.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256759069">
<p>
We checked on a curbside city information map, and saw that there was a south running Qianmen Dajie that ended at Tian’men Square, the tourist center of the city.  Heartened, we walked over to Qianmen Dajie and found a very clean, upscale tourist arcade with street car trams running the length of the street.  We felt certain this pedestrian street was the right one and even noticed a posting indicating that the “Ladies of the Month Vegetarian Restaurant” was nearby.  Walking south we finally found 58 Qianmen Dajie, but instead of finding Gongdelin the building contained Zara!  The young Zara staff seemed to know where the restaurant was, but we could not understand their instructions.  We really need a paper map of the city!  We also tried finding the Ladies Vegetarian Restaurant without any luck.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256760692">
<p>
In the end, we entered a hot pot restaurant with an English menu.  We picked out two types of mushrooms, cabbage, tofu, and vermicelli as our hot pot ingredients.  Everything arrived fresh and uncooked in little side dishes.  We then dipped the food into the boiling water of the hot pot to cook it, transferred it onto our plates and covered it in garlic sauce.  The food was fresh if boring.  It cost us ~150 yuan, or ~$24.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256762942">
<p>
Heartened again by having eaten and by having found a tourist safe sanctuary, we decided to walk north and see Tian’men Square itself.  This was only a one block walk, and we passed a national museum building along the way.  In the center of the square were more monument buildings and a large monolith monument too.  On the north end of the square were the gates with the hanging portrait of Chairman Mao.
</p>

<p>
All of these sights we saw through dense sooty smog, glowing in the street lights.  It only took two hours to make me feel the soot in my lungs.  The whole city of Beijing smells of coal.  My clothes smell of coal.  The cars here are covered in ash and my nose hairs tickle from captured ash.  I was already starting to cough after dinner, just like the locals who hack and spit on to the ground.  <editorial>I guess that the coughing passengers on this morning’s flight probably were not sick at all, just victims of the smog.</editorial>  Nothing here is completely clean for all the soot.  The people here look more weathered than the smooth, shiny people of Tokyo.
</p>

<p>
On the second try, we found a cabbie that knew how to get to our hotel.  It was a 12 yuan ride back to the north/east crook of the second ring road.  We showered, boiled water for brushing our teeth, thanked God we would be leaving Beijing’s atmosphere tomorrow, and then went to sleep in separate beds.
</p>

<p>
Some things I have noticed so far.  There is sooty smog everywhere.  The people here know less English, but there is good English signage.  People are more directed in their staring at us.  People here are noisier, less organized and less efficient than in Japan.  Our money goes further here and taxis are cheap.  The city has many 1 and 2 story buildings with colorful eastern looking facades.
</p>

<h3>10/29/09</h3>
<p>
We got up at 5:15 AM to finish packing and meet Glen by 6:00 AM.  The hotel had packed breakfast of two hard-boiled eggs, milk in a plastic bag, bread, jam, and meat plus a pear.  I ate the bread and an egg in the car to the airport but avoided the pear even though it looked great!  There was no traffic at this time of the morning.  We made it to the highly ornate tollbooths; Glen escorted us to the ticket counters, checked us in, and we parted with Glen at security.  I tipped him 100 yuan (about 15 dollars) but I don’t really know how much was actually expected or appropriate. I also get the feeling that we could have checked ourselves in just fine.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256798350">
<p>
We were in the less-impressive domestic terminal and waited with the noisy crowds heading to Kunming until our Lijiang flight was called.  We both worked on writing our journals and were greatly amused by the health information video of animated pigs avoiding swine flu and keeping healthy.  It was not just about Western style germ prevention but also had some lines about keeping a healthy unstressed mind for best health.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256814152">
<p>
We took off into the morning smog, very dense and already burning in my lungs and within five minutes were over more mountainous areas of little population.  We may have seen a squiggle of the Great Wall over the hills.  The smog persisted for a while, 3 hours of our 3.5 flight to Kunming.
</p>

<p>
For breakfast we had what appeared to be a traditional meal: white porridge, pickled veggies and eggs, maple yogurt and a meat sandwich.  Before landing, the crew led us all in an in-seat exercise routine; everyone participated.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256814593">
<p>
For the forty minutes before Kunming, we could see the dry, rugged, knife-edge mountains northeast of the city.  There were trees on some of the slopes, and there were many farms and terraces too.  The smog had cleared significantly, but it thickened a bit as Kunming came into sight.  It was “bad day in California” thick.  Kunming looks huge, with many tall apartment blocks in triplicate or more.  We had a very short layover with enough time to buy cucumber Lays potato chips; Kat really liked them, and I thought they were okay.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256819632">
<p>
The second flight was quick, maybe 1 hour long.  From the plane, we could see Jade Snow Mountain and the mountains that form Tiger Leaping Gorge.  We landed in a valley east of Lijiang, which itself is east of the mountain and south of the gorge.  
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256824097">
<p>
Outside baggage claim, we met Alvin, our guide for this area.  He took us to our driver, who honked his way away from the airport.  The driver would honk when passing anyone, so the others would know where he was.  He also honked at pedestrians crossing the street (traffic does not slow for them) and honked at ambling bicycles that shared the road.  Alvin told us that Lijiang has about 200,000 people, is at about 8,000 feet, and has no major industries besides farming and tourism.  For this reason, Lijiang has very little air pollution.  He also told us that 52 minorities of China live in Yunnan; 24 minorities are here in Lijiang.
</p>

<p>
The driver took us around the old town outskirts, going along the east, south and then western sides.  New Lijiang looked lively and fun itself.  When we stopped, I tried to tip the driver, but he would not take it.  I still have not figured out tipping here.  Alvin tells me not to tip at restaurants.  
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256825747">
<p>
Walking into the Old town, we found it to be absolutely beautiful.  The walkways are cobblestone, but made from an interesting conglomerate stone that looks a bit like modern polished concrete.  The stores and hotels are two or three stories high, have open storefronts on the street, are built of wood with tiled roofs, and are brightly painted and have intricate wood carvings too.  The streets are also full of flowers, some from the recent October 1 celebration <editorial> for 60 years of modern China</editorial>.
</p>

<p>
Our hotel is the Sanhe Hotel, which purports to be styled in the Naxi minority style.  Stan booked us in a standard double deluxe room, which is very comfortable, with wood furnishing that remind Kat of Switzerland, and a marble bathroom.  The sad surprise is that – yet again – we have separate beds.  The staff helped us push the beds together to make a King.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256827045">
<p>
Alvin then took us to a late lunch at Mishi.  We had warned him in the car that we are vegetarian, and so we were greeted with tofu and green soup, snow-peas, broccoli, mushrooms and bamboo.  There was enough food for four people!  All of the veggie dishes had a clear garlic sauce and let us taste the vegetables.  We were very happy to get some greens in us.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256829733">
<p>
Alvin departed after lunch, and we began to wander the old town.  We followed one long street to the very southernmost tip.  Along the way we passed restaurants, hotels, yak product stores, convenience stores, leather shops, local clothing and weaving shops, silver shops, wood-carving, calligraphy, travel guide/agents, sweet shops, and jewelry stores.  These same types of shop would show up over and over again, sometimes with very similar (the same?) products.  At first every building was a tourist business, but as we went south, services for the locals began to appear.  In the northern sections, the paths run along canals, which are lined with flowers and footbridges.  It is very pretty and even has Venice beat.  In the southern parts, the tourist glitz disappears, more construction projects are visible, as the locals create more “old town.”
</p>

</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256833954">
<p>
On our way south, I saw cushion covers that I really liked, and Kat and I stopped to look.  In other stores, they were marked as 15 yuan each, but this shopkeeper told us it was 30 yuan each.  We threatened to walk and in the end bought 3 covers for 70 yuan.  I am pretty sure that these are the exact covers that are 15 yuan elsewhere, but oh well, we’ll have to try much harder next time.
</p>

<p>
Alvin says that Lijiang received historical status in 1997 after a huge earthquake shook this region.  The old city largely withstood the earthquake, as the wood construction is flexible.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256834922">
<p>
Once we reached the end of the old town, we turned north again.  It was about 4:30 PM, and we saw locals bringing children home from school. Some were on bikes or scooters; most walked together.  In the old town, no cars are allowed, but some service vehicles drive about.  I’ve noticed that half of these vehicles are electric.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256836840">
<p>
We walked back past Mu’s residence, the local palace equivalent, and then headed west and up a hill.  At the top we found an over-look park with views of the city and the surrounding mountains, Jade Snow mountain included.  The park is crowned with a modern five story pagoda, and it was from this vantage point that we watched the sunset.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256841983">
<p>
Walking back to the hotel, we tried a bit of cake from a street vendor.  It was rice-flour based and unexciting.  After using the bathroom in the hotel, we ventured out again looking for dinner.  The city was now lit with lanterns and accent lighting and was very beautiful, especially along the canals.  The crowds are thicker at night than in the day.  We ate at Green Papaya “Italian” restaurant but ate off the local menu.  We had uninspiring Naxi wheat cake (a fried pancake) and not-fantastic eggplant.  To make it all obnoxious, an amplified, untalented musician was bombarding the street with folk/pop songs.  At least dinner was cheap, 25 yuan.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256850770">
<p>
On the way back to the hotel, Kat bought a drinkable yak yogurt from the market.  It was actually good; tastes honey and could pass as cow yogurt.
</p>

<p>
We are now ready for bed but will unfortunately have to endure the pounding bass from the bar district.  The pounding is not loud here but is clearly audible and not ignorable.  Stan should be told that this hotel’s location is too close to the bar route.
</p>

</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256890404">
<h3>10/30/2009</h3>

<p>
Regardless of the bumping bar beats, we fell asleep very quickly last night.  Among other things, I dreamt I was eating a white larva.  I bit into it, and even though it did not taste bad, I couldn’t finish eating a thing with so many legs, so I spit it back out.  
</p>

<p>
For real breakfast, we crossed the road to the Lamu Tibetan house that has a deal with our hotel.  They fed us toast, fried eggs, oatmeal and tea.  Here Katrina and I used email.  
</p>
</span>
<p>
<span class="timestamp" id="1256893030" style="display:inline;">
Alvin met us at 9:00 AM, and we started walking to the Jade Black Dragon Pool park.  It was still very cool out, maybe high 40s, so we had on sweaters and shells.
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256894312" style="display:inline;">
This park belonged to the local ruler Mu family.  From the lake, you can see Jade Dragon Snow Mountain reflecting in the water and also see Kneeling Elephant Hill on the side.  There is a bridge and a pagoda on the water that makes the vista extra-special.  The park’s pool is fed by a spring, and the locals were here with jugs for collecting the water and taking it home.
</span>  
</p>
<span class="timestamp" id="1256895107">
<p>
In the park, I touched a good luck “mahjong tree!”  In the park was also a temple to the snow mountain deity, represented in human form as a warrior on a horse.  Here we saw an artist doing “palm paintings,” where he used his hands as the brush and painted mountains and waterfalls.  Alvin told us about how the moon pagoda on the lake burned down in the 1940s when two Naxi lovers that were forbidden to marry committed suicide.  We would later learn in the Naxi cultural museum that love suicide was not uncommon since there were arranged marriages and suicide lovers would be together in the afterlife.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256897989">
<p>
We also learned that the marriage proposal is done by the boy giving the girl an embroidery needle.  If the girl then returns an embroidered piece of work to the boy, that means she has accepted.  
</p>

<p>
In one of the lakeside buildings, we got to see an example of the embroidery.  Three women were working on pieces, and lots of finished works were hung to see.  There were birds, flowers, cranes, tigers, and mountain landscapes, but the most memorable piece to me was a Mona Lisa reproduction.  The artists were able to create shading with their thread, by a kind of cross-hatching using multiple threads of similar tones.  The end result is very realistic when you stand back a few feet.  The costs of the larger pieces were in the 1000s of yuan.  Some pieces take many days to make or even many months.
</p>

<p>
Although this was a shopping opportunity, neither Alvin nor the shopkeeper was pushy in any way about our buying.  They just let us look around and leave when we wanted to.  This non-pushiness is typical for Lijiang, and I appreciate it.
</p>

<p>
We continued on, and Alvin told us about the “walking marriages” of the people living near Lake Lugo.  He says that if you are interested in someone, you tickle their palm during the community dance; if they tickle you back, you are set.  In this matrilineal society, there are no marriages.  Rather, men go to the homes of their girlfriends in the night and make sure to leave by daybreak.  Men and women may change lovers freely and children only have moms, not dads.  Uncles to children also play important roles in up-bringing.  
</p>

<p>
Alvin dropped us off at the Naxi cultural museum, and the guide there showed us Naxi costumes, told us about Naxi elders (only 30 are left for 300,000 Naxi), and about their still-used pictogram alphabet and about marriage ceremonies.  
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256900177">
<p>
Alvin then walked us along New Town to old town (and passed a mother holding her son over some newspaper on the sidewalk so that he could poop!) and then took us a back way to Mu’s place.  Mu’s Place is mostly a reconstruction, but the original rivaled the Forbidden City.  Mu’s also has its important buildings in a row.  First is the meeting and the war hall, then the hall of learning/reading, then the hall of justice, then finally the hall of entertainment.  Up on the hill was a functioning Taoist temple.  The residences were to the side of the main axis and were rather modest.  Like the rest of Lijiang, the grounds were very flowery and incorporated running water canals.  The Mu family occupied the place from Kubla Khan up until the last Emperor and was opportunistic about their alliances.  They realized that they could not fight strong invaders; so they welcomed them instead.  The Mu family is a Naxi line.
</p>

<p>
Alvin said that a poor income in Lijiang is about 500 yuan per month.  A medium income is 2,000 to 4,000 yuan.  The rich income I don’t remember but was closer to 10,000 a month.  Only rich families have cars.  Some families with homes in the old city can rent their homes and have all the income they need for living in the new city.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256908166">
<p>
Alvin then took us by mini-bus into the new city for dumplings.  The bus was a small van and cost 1 yuan per person.  The dumpling shop was only four minutes away and was a modern place with glass walls.  It had the typical high tables so appreciated after Japan.  Alvin ordered 20 dumplings of each vegetarian type: noodle and cabbage, summer squash, and leek.  We also ordered pumpkin cakes with sweet cheese sauce.  I liked everything very much, but 20 dumplings a piece is way too much!  Then Alvin went and ordered another 20!  We told Alvin our Egyptian feast story and accused him of over-feeding us.  In the end, we took a doggie bag with 18 dumplings home.  (One hour later, Katrina and I both had tummy aches.)
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256910852">
<p>
Next we walked around the vegetable market.  There were animal products and live animals too, fish (all live), eels, frogs, turtles, chickens which we avoided seeing, Chinese medicine stands (with dried lizards), brassware and clothes.  It was quite a large market.  In general the veggies and fruit looked good, but I am too suspicious of Chinese sanitation to sample anything.  I would like to try a peel-covered fruit, but how can I peel it without touching the insides too?
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256911826">
<p>
Finally Alvin walked us here and there back to the hotel.  We stopped to buy postcards but were turned off by the price.  Alvin took us to the supermarket and helped us pick out red wine from the Kunming area.  We tried it later and were not so impressed!  
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256921853">
<p>
It was only 3 PM, but our belly aches had hit, so we rested in bed until 4:30 PM.  Then we headed to the theater in new town for our Minority Culture Dance Extravaganza.  We had fourth row seats (the row was too short for my knees).  Like many things Chinese, the volume was turned up too loud.  The opening act was a Chinese orchestra, and one of the back row musicians was staring at me during the whole piece!  Accepted crowd behavior is different, because people were talking, taking video and even flash photography, and arriving late to the show.  
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256924381">
<p>
The rest of the acts were dance pieces with recorded music and song played over the speakers.  Lots of fog machine and spot lighting effects were used.  Most were fun but some could induce seizures!  The dances were a mix of modern dance with native costume, plus with native story and ritual mixed in.  The ever-present silk sheets as waves were used, and there was some flying rope/sheet action too, just like in Hawaii.  
</p>

<p>
Overall it was fun, funny and enjoyable, mainly because it was so over the top.  Kat thinks that the dancers were from the representative minorities; I’m skeptical, and I think many were Han.
</p>

<p>
After the show, we came home to prepare for tomorrow’s hike and go to sleep.
</p>

</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256972528">
<h3>10/31/09</h3>
<p>
We got up at 5:30am to meet Alvin at 6am.  It was still dark as we drove out of Lijiang and over the mountains towards Shangri La.  The first lightening of the sky happened around 7am, after we had traveled up the first line of mountains, down the tree lined highway and were about to descend into Shangri La.  Viewing the mountains as early morning silhouettes made the mountains’ heft and mass visible and at the same time hide the man-made scars of farms, quarries and factories.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256973229">
<p>
The sun was up enough to see all those other details by the time the highway had descended to the valley floor and was tracking along the Yangtze River.  Lots of farms of corn or tobacco are built in terraces on the valley walls.  The valley was already filling with disappointing smoke from cooking fires and the handful of factories.  Shangri La itself was a medium sized town that did not look interesting at all from the road.  It is on the west bank of the Yangtze.  The forks in Shangri La – well, perhaps it is met by a tributary here – and at this junction is a massive amount of deposited gravel.  Trucks were working to extract the gravel.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256975943">
<p>
Our driver took us up the ever narrowing gorge to a viewpoint.  We were across the river from Jade Snow Mountain, on the slope of his “brother” mountain Haba.  Haba Snow Mountain is almost the same size as Jade Snow Mountain.  Alvin told us that the Yangtze was a beautiful girl, trying to find her mother at the sea.  The two brother mountains tried to stop her in her journey to the sea because they wanted her to stay with them.  She danced from them for seven nights until the brothers fell asleep and then she slipped off to the sea.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256976114">
<p>
It was still only 8am by this point, and we decided to walk down the tourist path to the river rapids below.  In 1986, ten Chinese rafters tried to navigate the Tiger Leaping Gorge and three of the party died in the attempt.  When we got out of the van, it was very cold outside and I was worried that we had not packed enough clothes.  I had brought zip-off pants, wool socks, a t-shirt, a thermal shirt, a long sleeve shirt, a rain shell and a winter hat.  Katrina also looked cold.
</p>

<p>
We went to use the bathrooms and found Chinese trough toilets with no doors and only cubicle height partitions for privacy.  This was fine for me for peeing, but Katrina could not handle the lack of amenity for her needs.  We shivered our way down 10 minutes worth of steps to the water.  The Yangtze is very brown, and in this constricted passage it was roiled in to one large flow of white water.  The rapid is huge, but does not last long until the next path of calm water.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256977378">
<p>
We started climbing back up the steps and then Katrina had a break-down.  I think she was worried about the cold weather and the poor toilet facilities, angry for having demanded that we leave at 6am and as a result we had missed 1 hour worth of mountain scenery in the dark, and concerned that just these 10 minutes of stairs were so difficult and we had yet to start our long hike!  Kat did recover herself and we boarded the van to continue on.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256979167">
<p>
The van dropped us off just 10 minutes up stream from the river stairs.  I was wearing my backpacking pack with the extra clothing and water, Katrina had her small daypack.  Alvin also had packed in just a day pack.  
</p>

<p>
We hiked along the road at first, climbing to a small village with a school where children waved to us from the third floor window and said “hi!”  Within 30 minutes all our fears of being too cold had subsided, and we were peeling off layers to get down to our t-shirts.  
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256979808">
<p>
We passed farms with corn and pumpkins.  The corn is being dried and then husked for feed.  We also passed a few fellows offering horse rides to hikers making the initial climb.  The road narrowed down to a one-person track, and the climb got harder as we neared the 2 hour point and the Naxi Guesthouse.  Along the track were good views of Jade Snow Mountain and its multiple peaks.  The mountain rises almost 5,000 meters, while the river is at 1,500 meters elevation.  The upstream peaks are the ones covered with snow, though on this side of the mountain there is no glacier.  From here, you can only see the edge of the Lijiang facing glacier running along the tip of one peak.  The peaks are sharp and jagged like saw teeth, and the view from river to mountain top is so vertically large that it was hard to comprehend and even made me slightly disoriented.  I had a similar feeling of being out of my element in Muren, Switzerland, but I think the elevation difference was more extreme there in the Alps.  The Tiger Leaping Gorge trail is very dusty, and our boots were completely dirty by 11am when we reached the Naxi Guesthouse.

At Naxi GH, we had a lunch of broccoli, snow peas, fried noodles with vegetables, and pumpkin soup.  All the dishes were very good and not so spice in white sauces.  Alvin says the locals make non-spicy dishes for foreign guests.  We ate in the nice inner courtyard of the guesthouse at a very low table.  Katrina used the free internet connection and I got some bottled water and cookies for our hike.  Each of our lunch plates cost about 7 yuan, and Alvin threatened to be “an Egyptian” and force us to order more food.  I get the feeling he has a much larger lunch budget for us than is needed for vegetarians.  To appease Alvin we got a strawberry syrup pancake to eat later on the path.

We were only the forth people down the path that morning when we left from the Naxi Guesthouse.  The climb got much more serious as we approached the 28 Bends.  We kept hitting switchbacks and asking Alvin if this was the 1st bend of the 28.  No, no, and no.  We passed a concession stand and then the countable bends started.  We counted them in Chinese together, taking frequent breaks and drinking lots of water.  The face we were climbing looked to be 70 degrees steep and climbed the face of Haba Mountain very quickly.  Somehow we managed to count 30 bends on the climb!  Oh well.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256992699">
<p>
The climb peaked at 2,600 meters of elevation.  Here was another small concession stand.  The sales woman wanted 8 yuan to let us take photos from a razor spit above the gorge!  On principle we refused, and just took pictures from the path instead.  The view was still quite good and let you look from river to peak.  At this point in the hike, the 5 or more peaks of the “dragon’s back” were all lined up in a row and all individually visible.
</p>

<p>
The next section of trail was a descent across a very steep slope.  Alvin slipped a few times but remained on his feet and, more importantly, on the trail!  There was forest and some bamboo on our mountain side.  We could see the other hiking party ahead of us.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256995810">
<p>
When the descent slowed and the forest dropped away, we came to a great view point looking south up the river.  We could see the steps down to the rapids that we had hiked in the morning.  By now, the area was full of busses.  The annoying smoke from the morning had mostly blown clear out of the gorge too.  The view point was fantastic, and you could feel the steepness of both sides of the river.  We ate our strawberry cake here as we enjoyed the view.
</p>

<p>
The following 1.5 hours to Tea-Horse Guesthouse stayed mostly level as it crossed the mountainside.  Jade Snow Mountain was on our right as we hiked.  The mountain’s angles shifted slowly as we moved, and the dragon’s back line of peaks started scrunching together.  The path here was precipitously steep off the sides.  If any of us had a fear of heights we would have known it then.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256998580">
<p>
Tea-Horse GH was in a village with drivable access to the low river road of our morning stair climb.  At Tea-Horse, we restocked our water supplies.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1256999454">
<p>
The forests of the morning faded away and the vistas began opening up to the north.  It appears that the gorge is narrower to the north, even though the tallest Jade Mountain peaks are in the south.  On our side of Haba Mountain the slope was getting even steeper, the foliages drier and more ferns and scrub brush was present.  
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257002355">
<p>
We passed an overhang that looked like a man’s profile about 1.5 hours before the hike ended.  In the valley below, Alvin pointed out a factory that extracts wostun (?) from the mountain.  From time to time we would see goat herds and herders.  Terraced farms could also be seen down below.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257004773">
<p>
Finally, around 4 pm we saw the village of the Halfway House.  This village too is serviced by the low river road, and there is a fantastic section of switch backs that climb to it.  The guesthouse has three stories of rooms, most with mountain views and all occupied!  We go stuck in a ground-floor room with less of a view, but the room does have a private bathroom with a western toilet and shower.
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257007186">
<p>
We had a dinner of fried mixed veggies including cauliflower and tomatoes, egg noodles and chocolate pancake.  We ate up on the rooftop “inspiration” deck with French, Israeli, British, Scottish and Irish travelers for company.  Most were on longer trips than us – one girl was wrapping up one year of travels!
</p>
</span><span class="timestamp" id="1257010773">
<p>
The sunset cast nice color on the Jade Snow Mountain and then a nearly full moon rose above the peaks.  So pretty!  Katrina and I talked to an Irish guy and a British girl about their travels and experiences in China.  We retired around 8pm to write.
</p>

<p>
Oh, it seems that Katrina lost 500 photos taken from when we were in Takayama up until today!  I hope we can recover them from the memory card!
